"Aesthetics: 5 out of 5 stars - Looks great, and feels great in the hand. It is very smooth, sleek, organic-looking, and ergonomic.<br />Material: 4/5 stars - High-quality plastic. Most of the remote is made of shiny/glossy plastic, while the button panel/area is a matte plastic.<br />Craftsmanship: 5/5 - Built well, no creaks with the creases and button areas while handling/pressing the buttons. The buttons have a nice firm &#34;click&#34; and tactile response.<br />Size/Weight: 5/5 - It is right at 6 inches long, and weighs 4.25 ounces with the 2 AA batteries installed.<br />Functionality: 3 out of 5 stars - While the remote itself is high-quality, beautiful, lightweight, and easy to function, the functionality is lacking. First, it takes a while to get use to the &#34;air mouse/Wii controller&#34; functionality and to wave it around and properly place it over the areas where you want to click. Second, when you perform a button press, the controller naturally is lowered because of your button-pressing movement, so you have to be very still and precise when you press the button. Finally, there is no dedicated &#34;OK/Enter&#34; button - rather, you press down on the scroll wheel like on some mouses. But because you have to click down on a scroll wheel, it is very easy to slip off the scroll wheel and miss the press, or have the pointer move out of place and miss the area where you are supposed to click on.<br />The other negative is - although there are few buttons on the controller so you don't get caught in &#34;button-hunting&#34; - there are not many dedicated buttons to function what you want. So to bring up the settings menu, you have to click on the &#34;home&#34; button, then move the point or directional button to the settings on-screen button, then lick the scroll wheel. There is also no button to quickly change the video/visual modes, so if you're watching a news program, and switch over to a movie, you can't switch from standard to cinema mode easily, and have to go through that whole procedure to get into the settings menu again. There is also no dedicated Netflix button, no channel number buttons, and so on and so on.<br /><br />So in the end, although this is a good remote control, there is still a lot of room for improvement. I recommend the 2015 edition - model number AN-MR600 - but on the LG website it lists that it can work only with certain 2015 TVs, and are not backward-compatible. Let's hope LG comes up with a firmware update so you can use the 600 version with older TVs.d have to go through that whole procedure to get into the settings menu again.

"These earphones worked well for about 2-3 months. The volume/play controller located close to the left ear bud stopped working after 3 months of use.

This adapter does what its supposed to but for a very short period of time. It literally fell apart-- like into pieces-- because the housing was made of cheap plastic.

"I'm a former recording engineer so you can take my word that the inexpensive Sherwood Model 4109, 4105 and this model are exceptionally good sounding amplifier/Tuners.

"I don't have a lot of desk real estate and I wanted something that pumps out a punchy deep sound when I'm playing really action packed games, watching movies and listening to my music (mostly EDM). The Leviathan was a fantastic option. I am a member of the cult of Razer and I trust their products and this is why. It just works beautifully.<br /><br />The soundbar gives you a host of options for connection. You can use NFC to pair your phone through bluetooth just by tapping your phone on it. The SDPIF connection in the back lets you use 5.1 fiber optic sound from your PC, Mac or gaming console and really does resonate a clear wide sound field. It's not true 5.1 so it won't beat a real surround sound system, but when racing in Forza Horizon 2 I could hear cars coming up behind me with clarity. There is also a traditional headphone style input which is very nice for quick on the fly plug ins.<br /><br />The only gripes I have are that the connector for the subwoofer is a little goofy. It doesn't seem as strong of a connection as it could be... maybe a bit flimsy. But these things don't move so once you get it in place it'll be fine. The other little problem I have are the attachable feet. Two sets come with the bar to let you raise and angle the bar how you want it. But try removing them and the glue holding the feet to the plug portion pops right off. I had to re-glue them in place.<br /><br />The last option is that there's no pass through. I would have really liked if I could have run my sound into the sound bar and then to headphones. Right now I have a SPDIF splitter for my fiber optic signal. One goes to the soundbar the other goes to my Astro Mix Amp for my headphones. It's not a very elegant solution and I hate the extra cables. Maybe the Leviathan Pro can include something like that, and maybe it'll even have some of Razer's Chroma lighting accents which would be nice.",negative

"I bought the [[ASIN:B00JBGOIW0 Acuvar High Capacity AA Rechargeable Batteries]] just to check out the unbelievable capacity claim of '3100mAh'. Actually, I already knew from experience that any AA NiMH cell advertising 3000mAh or over is too good to be true. Yet people kept bugging me to test this product. So this exercise is just to remove all doubts.<br /><br />I tested a set of 4 Acuvar AA cells using my [[ASIN:B004J6DLD4 La Crosse BC1000 Battery Charger]]. Here are my observations:<br />- Right out of the package, the average remaining capacity was 1111mAH, or just 35% of the rated capacity.<br />- After one Recharge/Discharge cycle, the average capacity improved to 1514mAh.<br />- After another two more recharge/discharge cycles, the average capacity settled at 1552mAh, or 50% of the advertised '3100mAh'.<br /><br />Just to make sure that the low capacity reading is not due to my charger, I re-tested those Acuvar cells using my [[ASIN:B003DIGKOG PowerEx MH-C9000 Charger-Analyzer]]. I put all 4 cells though another three Discharge/Recharge cycles on this charger, and monitored the progress of capacity numbers reported. In the end, the average capacity remains virtually unchanged at 1470mAh. (Note that my MH-C9000 always report about 5% lower capacity reading compared to my BC1000).<br /><br />Another tell-tale sign of low capacity battery is the weight. Those Acuvar AA cells are only 22g each according to my electronic kitchen scale. The [[ASIN:B00HZV9WTM AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries]], for example, are 30g each.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Those Acuvar AA batteries are advertised as '3100mAh', but the actual measured capacity is just 50% of that. This is simply false advertisement. The product should be removed from Amazon product page if the company still has any integrity left.<br /><br />Finally, If you need some inexpensive NiMH cells with honest capacity ratings, try:<br />- [[ASIN:B00410B734 Tenergy Centura AA LSD NiMH Rechargeable Batteries]]: rated 2000mAh and measured around 2100mAh according to my BC1000.<br />- [[ASIN:B00BU9YHIQ GP Recyko AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]]: rated 2100mAh and tested over 2200mAh.<br />- [[ASIN:B00CWNMR5Y AmazonBasics AA Rechargeable Batteries]]: rated 2000mAh and measured close to 2100mAh. They are most likely rebranded [[ASIN:B003VLAEPQ Sanyo Eneloop]].e Batteries]]: rated 2000mAh and measured around 2100mAh according to my BC1000.<br />- [[ASIN:B00BU9YHIQ GP Recyko AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]]: rated 2100mAh and tested over 2200mAh.<br />- [[ASIN:B00CWNMR5Y AmazonBasics AA Rechargeable Batteries]]: rated 2000mAh and measured close to 2100mAh.

Unfortunately, it only switches automatically sometimes, when you shut one device off to the device that's on. Furthermore, a warning to those that are sensitive to light, this product always has a light on that is very bright, so I had to put mine behind the tv, but I ended up using a new one with a remote because I wanted one to automatically switch and I wanted to have the option to switch between different ports through a remote so if I wanted to play multiple games systems, I can easily switch to them.",negative

"A bit difficult to put on the first few times wearing them but I am getting use to them now. I like the three sizes of ear buds that they come with so that the headphones can fit a variety of ears. Edit: These stopped working after only a few months of use. Now, the head phone jack doesn't completely connect to the port on my phone, ipod, and computer making audio cut in and out if I so much as move the device. Completely useless now that I have to keep my device still if I want the headphones to work. And their return policy (limited life-time warranty) makes it so you have to pay for shipping and handling ($9+) so it is not worth mailing it in to get it fixed or replaced.",negative

"Works very well, up converts my Laserdisc player to HDMI.",positive
"These speakers are fairly unique in that they take a Bluetooth signal and convert it into another format. In terms of connectivity these work as long as the transmitter unit is close by.<br /><br />These speakers use 6 AA batteries, i.e. they work off 9 Volts. An easy calculation shows that the peak wattage of these is around 10 Watts. More than that and the signal clips. Since music signals are not uniform, effective RMS wattage is around 2.5 Watts. Any more and the peaks in the music will start clipping. Also, you would not be able to drain 1 amp of current from batteries for a long period of time which is another limiting factor.<br /><br />In practice I found the 2.5 Watts to be fairly accurate. If the speakers are less than 5 feet away then they are useful. Any farther and the music gets drowned out in the wind. I am not an audiophile but I would hope that the manufacturer would improve the sound quality. For $200 I would expect more in terms of acoustics than what these speakers deliver.<br /><br />I do like that these come with a remote control and are portable. However the low wattage and mediocre sound result in 2 stars.",positive

"Battery lasts a long time. The sound is really good for such a small speaker. Got this from a friend. Love the volume buttons and solid on/off switch on the side. Pretty compact to take anywhere.

They don't provide a mind-blowing sound but as someone who uses headphones for intense weight training I've found this product to be extremely durable in comparison to other headphones.  I've sweat on them quite a bit and even stepped on them a few times and they held up.,positive
"This was my first speaker so I didn't really know what to expect. It worked well enough but didn't retain a charge well and unless I remembered to shut it off, would run through the entire battery so I was constantly charging it. The Magicbox lasted about 5 months and then stopped working completely. Around the same time, I received a Jambox as a gift LOVE it! The sound quality is incomparable and I just used it for 3 hours and it still has a 60% charge. If you need a cheapo speaker and are not expecting much, the Magicbox works but if you want quality I would splurge on the Jambox.",positive

"Pros:  * Good sound  * Easy to Setup  * Easily Pairable  * Buttons for volume and play/pause are a nice feature  * Can integrate with home automation/ IoT Cons:  * Many limitations on what you can play  * Not great for spoken word  * Lack of audiobook/ podcast support  * Does not support bluetooth/ streaming  * Unhelpful costumer service (as far as features, see note about Sonos forums below)  * Pricey for lack of features compared to competitors  * App is lackluster  After looking at Sonos for a couple years, I decided to start off with a single Play 3 to see if I liked the overall Sonos system. Before I bought in I had read about the pros and cons of the product and was pretty well informed. I immediately enjoyed listening to Sirius/ XM Radio, IHeartRadio and music from my cell phone played through the Sonos app on my Android.  The sound quality is really nice. The bass is clear, the treble is nice and the mids are all very audible for music. When turned up this speaker can really make some noise and put out crisp loud bass. The audio distorts a bit at the loudest levels but I have never come close to playing around that volume. I comfortably listen at around 35-40% volume, so there is a lot of room to get louder from this single speaker.  For spoken word and talk radio the bass can be a bit much, it's clearly calibrated for music, even when  the eq is tweaked to lower the bass end.  The Sonos system however is somewhat to very limited. There are a handful of streaming services that are handled through Sonos app which can be run on a smartphone, a tablet or a computer. These sources include streaming services like Spotify, Tidal, Stitcher and Sirius XM along with anything on the device or computer the application is installed on. In addition you can pull from a media server if you have one installed on your network.  My biggest issue and reason for the rating is the limitations of the system. Without buying a Sonos Playbar, Play 5 or Sonos Connect you are unable to pull audio from any video source. This means you can't play audio from the television, computer, youtube or even other streaming services like BBC.  Sonos doesn't natively support Audible or any other audiobook sources. Worse yet, if you play an audio book as local media, there is no way for Sonos to remember your place if you change tracks. If you are into podcasts the same issue arises along with the fact that you can only play the most recent podcast from services like Stitcher.  Despite the crystal clear sound and the promise to connect multiple rooms the $300 a good test, but I don't think I'll fully buy in. With so many companies opening up their tech to their knowledgeable community and even just listening to what their customers want, Sonos seems stuck with an old mentality of &#34;you'll get what we give you.&#34; Take a look at their Sonos Community forum and there are hundreds of threads dating back to the mid 2000's with replies from Sonos at most saying &#34;Sonos currently doesn't support this feature&#34;.  There are work arounds to several of these issues, but these should all be options if not native to the Sonos system. I find myself grabbing my $20 bluetooth speaker to listen to podcasts way too often.  Sonos is an awesome idea and a great tech, but there are a lot of speaker companies out there and many wireless speaker products as well. Sonos sounds great, but the limitations really left a lot to be desired.",positive

"This inexpensive In-Ear Headphone set provides surprisingly good audio fidelity, especially given the price. I now have two sets of these and I keep them stashed for handy access in my car and at work (who knows, I may buy more to stash elsewhere - like my girlfriend's car). A pleasant surprise was how comfortable they are in my ear, but your mileage may very on that. When I first received them, I did an audio comparison using 'White Rabbit' by the Jefferson Airplane as the audio source. I compared these to my Sony Headphones, an Apple earbud, and a Koss earbud. To my surprise, they beat the Koss earbud. (imho) I'm giving this set a solid 3 stars for the sound which I think is pretty good for a set of earbuds... and another star for the comfort. (actually, only a half star) Honestly, I don't think you can go too wrong if you buy these.",positive
Theses sticks are very hard to put on and don't cover the headphones all away.There very pretty but don't work,negative
"Being such a simple product, it really has only a couple of duties: Conduct electricity and separate the battery from the outside world. Unfortunately, it failed me on the latter, and something tells me the former is questionable as well. The very first one I tried closing broke while trying to close it, so the lid no longer stays on. The way the lid &#34;clicks&#34; on feels very flimsy when there is no battery (it would practically open just be touching it). Then when the battery is in there, the thing is almost impossible to close. As for conductivity, the switches feel flimsy as well, as if they too would break after perhaps a hundred or so times of flipping them. If sturdiness is your goal, I recommend avoiding these. For nearly a dollar per piece of plastic, I expected higher quality. I mean, even a soda bottle has vastly superior quality yet is meant to be disposable.",positive
Do not buy this unit. Buy the Sony BCG-34HRE... it works perfectly. I gave it 2 stars because it does charge batteries but takes a very very long time compared to the Sony BCG-34HRE which rocks!!!!,positive

Nice bag and cloth included<br /><br />The cons that keep it from 5 stars<br />1) The arms on the glasses are to long so if you lean back on something with you head they sometimes get pushed forward. It can be a little annoying at times.<br />2) The small usb plugin is kinda recessed a bit and your normal charger for you phone works but doesn't get that satisfying click or feel like its secure, but don't worry the cable provided has a slightly longer plug that works just fine. Had to switch out the cable on my charger.<br /><br />But all in all these are great glasses and would highly recommend for the price just two things that need to be looked at.",positive
Red zip ties.  Exactly what I wanted as I have a thing for red.<br /><br />Strong plastic tie.

Although the sound quality is really good ( at least for jazz and blues), the Bluetooth cuts out frequently if the iPad or iPhone is more than 12 inches away from the speaker.

If rating this speaker on sound quality and ease of set up alone I would give it 4 stars, but with the connectivity issue I can't do any better than one.",positive

Im very pleased with this product. Easy to use and good sound.,positive
I have a shaved head; the headphones do not stay on my head if I bend over. I decided to return them.  I sent them back but NEVER received confirmation or compensation. The sound quality was decent but could have been louder.,positive
"I have another iHome sports ear hook headphones that rock. I still have them a year later. I decided to get another set but couldn't  find the same ones so I got this version. They didn't fit as well. The angle the earbud enters your ear canal is uncomfortable but the biggest drawback are the removable ear hooks. The headphone wire feeds through a channel in the ear hook. After a few uses the channel won't hold the wire securely. Also the ear hook pops off of the earbud making the ear hook useless. Find headphones where the ear hook is molded into the earbud.<br />This set had decent sound (bass) quality when seated deep in the ear canal but within a month the looseness of the ear hook and the angle of the earbud made the earbud come out far enough to destroy any sound and let in ambient noise.  I used them for exercise.<br />Lastly, at the point where the wires exit the ear hook is at an angle that causes the wires to bend and they were becoming brittle.<br />The other iHome earbuds I have, have taken a beating and still rock after nearly a year.",negative

"**Update** After 6 months of use, the bluetooth died on me today. I can no longer get any lights to turn on, or sound to come out over bluetooth. Wired the headphones still work, but beware that the bluetooth can just die. These have also only been lightly used, and have not been abused at all.<br /><br />These headphones rock. No, seriously, the power that can come out of these headphones is awesome. That being said, let's get down to business:<br /><br />The build quality of these headphones are good to great. They are a mixture of metal and plastic, but in no way to they feel flimsy. The cups themselves are predominantly plastic, while the headband has a good amount of metal lining the band for strength. The padding on the cups is very soft, though is not memory foam, just traditional foam. Also there is a faux leather like material lining both the headband and on the cups.<br /><br />Design wise, the headphones are sleek, and the way they fold up is very clever, and I feel far more durable than other headphones. That being said, JBL definitely was not shy in their branding of these headphones, with their logo clearly written on the outside of each cup as well as across the top band. They look great though, truly. Definitely a 'cool' pair of headphones.<br /><br />These headphones do have some wearability problems in my case though. As someone with a large head, I have to max out the band extension to get them to fit on my ears, however they DO fit on my ears. So as the upper spectrum of head sizes, I can say that they do sit well. Further, the cups are fairly large (50mm drivers), and while the cups rotate in the lay flat, I would not recommend this while wearing them around your neck, as they straight up choke me. To wear them around your neck you need to leave them in their normal rotation, which messes with your ability to turn your head. Also, the band is fairly tight, and these headphones squeeze my head a good deal, but that could be a nice thing if you use them for working out or exercising.<br />The largest criticism I have of these headphones though is their choice of circular cup design. While it looks great, they don't truly surround my ear, and sit right on the tops and bottoms of my ear, as an on-ear model would. This causes me to have to remove them once an hour or so as it can get uncomfortable and my ears start to feel really hot. I think a more accurate description of them is &#34;mostly over-the-ear headphones&#34;.<br /><br />Now for the good parts, the sound. They blow me away. Solid, crisp basses, clear mids, and crisp highs. As a amateur audiophile, I am very happy with the sound quality of these headphones, and they sound like much more expensive headphones. And boy do they have power. They can get uncomfortably loud, but that is easily managed by either the volume on your device, or on the headphones themselves. As far as an internal equalizer though, the sound is a bit flat, so if you want to customize your EQ it will have to be on the music device itself. Though, with the properly tuned EQ they are some of the best sounded headphones, period.<br /><br />As far as the technology, there isn't much to say. The bluetooth works great and I can get about 30 feet of range out of them. Battery life is realistically 25 hours or so, and charging takes a couple hours. The cord to plug them for wired mode is nice, though bluetooth technology has come so far I can hardly hear a difference between wired and wireless. The built in mic is fine, and people on the other sides of phone calls have reported that they can hear me clearly. The buttons on the device are not the most intuitive, but they work fine once you get used to the command patterns (double tap, triple tap, etc). As for the music sharing feature, I never got to test that, as I am the only one in my household with JBL headphones. It sounds like a nice feature though.<br /><br />TL/DR: Great headphones for the cost. While I wish they truly surrounded my ears, they are comfortable nonetheless. The audio quality is fantastic, and I have no regrets after purchasing these headphones.y ears, they are comfortable nonetheless. The audio quality is fantastic, and I have no regrets after purchasing these headphones.",positive

"My 2010 Lg plasma television weighs approx. 88 lbs the original base stand was lost a while back for this unit was wall mounted. My wife and I remodeled our living room chose to put television on cabinet instead. I thought it would be simple enough to order a cabinet television mount on-line. I did a lot of on line searching till I finally found OLLO products line. In their web page they show several original equipment mounts as well as universal mounts. The mount I selected was between one describing a 30-50&#34; support mount and a 30-60&#34; support mount. I opted for the larger one obviously because product description stated it would support up to an 80 lb. television. ( Mine weights about 88 lbs.) Oh! and the smaller of the two showed a price of $55.99 discounted from $74.99. The mount I ordered priced out at $84.99 down from $149.99,  also amazon did not send me a copy of my bill but an order confirmation statement only! Since I ordered on line maybe this is standard practice for them, I don't know can not even show item numbers, none the less instead of going through any return hassle I keep this mount. Future OLLO buyers beware totally NOT satisfied. I did not see anywhere on the amazon page easy copy button. Resent using amazon about know!",positive

Do your research and read the reviews before buying these headphones.  I purchased my first pair in July 2014.  I've been through four replacement pair since the original purchase.

"When you showering, for some reason, all of a sudden your phone rings and you are like, “How am I going to answer it if I’m taking a shower?” Then you answer it, your phone gets water all over it, it may fall during the process of this phone call and by then, you are not a happy camper. If you don’t want this to happen to you, I suggest you get the Pyle Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth Speaker. You might ask, what’s so good about it, it might be like any other waterproof speaker. I doubt that. This is not an ordinary waterproof speaker. You can actually hear your music and talk to someone on the phone without having to touch your phone. You connect your phone and the speaker by Bluetooth and voila, hands-free.  Your phone doesn’t have to be there while you are showering (that’s how you damage the speaker because of the humidity of the shower, just FYI). You can leave your phone in your room and the Bluetooth speaker will still be connected to it. Amazing, I know! Now, previously, I have bought a Bluetooth speaker and the sound was pretty bad. I couldn’t hear the music and I was disappointed but with Pyle, the sound was truly amazing. I can put the volume high and it’s amazing the crystal clear sound that it has. It’s like if I have my phone on speaker. I have used this every day and I love how loud the speaker is. Now, you are probably asking, it can’t be that good with calls, can’t it? Yes, it is! I actually tried it and I was a bit skeptical, at first. Let me tell you, it is very crystal clear and even though I’m showering, I can still hear the person I am talking to you. I was actually showering and the speaker stopped playing the music and started ringing. FYI, this speaker did not ring my actual ringtone from my phone. It started beeping. I figured someone was calling me. I pushed the call button and it was my sister. We were actually having a conversation while I was showering. I didn’t have any issues with static, sound or etc. The connection was fine and she heard me crystal clear. This is a nifty device because the battery is long lasting, you charge it up and it doesn’t take long to charge. It connects fast to Bluetooth and I just have to repeat, the sound is great! If you like hearing music and taking calls while showering but don’t want to damage the speakers of your phone with humidity or water, then this is the device for you.<br /><br />I enjoyed reviewing this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion.nnection was fine and she heard me crystal clear.

"You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Instead of going to a bigbox store and shelling out thirty-five dollars for yet another DirecTV remote control -- all of which seem to wear out in a year or so anyways -- my family decided to purchase this cheapie.<br /><br />Ours is a small house and the fact that this cheap remote is IR rather than RF has made absolutely no difference in our lives. All the buttons WORK JUST FINE with our DirecTV receiver. We possibly may have now developed a more-pointed habit of aiming this IR remote directly STRAIGHT towards the receiver -- I can't honestly tell -- but I might still say IR is a plus: if somebody picks up this remote while the TV is on, and a button is unintentionally pressed, then it's far less likely the channel you're viewing gets changed by accident.<br /><br />In short, this cheapie at first seems like excellent value. BUT THERE ARE TWO MAJOR DRAWBACKS!<br /><br />FIRST: the molded plastic backing on this remote has a HORRIBLE CHEMICAL SMELL. Hold it and the chemical smell will linger on your hand long afterwards. Is it benzene? I'm wondering: have I exposed my family to a DANGEROUS CARCINOGEN? For a while, every time I used the remote, I immediately washed my hands afterwards, to get rid of the smell and (hopefully) any chemical residue. Other members of my family weren't so fussy, and I hope they will not regret this. The more expensive DirecTV remotes use hard plastic backing -- this cheapie uses a soft and textured molded plastic -- I'm guessing chemicals are used to make the plastic soft and pliable. In any case, this is the first DirecTV remote I've owned that emitted a NOXIOUS ODOR. After about two or three months, the odor did wear off; but I still wonder if the chemicals used in manufacturing this product will provide my family with grounds for a lawsuit.<br /><br />SECOND: I purchased the remote in mid-January of this year (2015). By the time March came to an end, not only had the chemical smell worn off, but the molded-plastic backing had begun a process of FALLING APART. We hadn't even owned this remote for three months and it was already FALLING APART. But only the backing was peeling off. The remote's control-panel still works just fine. We applied black electrical tape to the backing … and applied more and more tape as weeks passed; but all this didn't matter. The remote no longer had a nice &#34;hold&#34; feel, its backing bulged out in various places, and the sticky residue from the tape made hands icky. Yesterday, so much of the backing had peeled off that I finally yanked it all off entirely. I used an alcohol-soaked cottonball to rub off our tape's residue, and the original glue used by Chinese manufacturers to hold the backing in place? I'm guessing this glue simply dried up. Any glue residue left is as hard as the remote's own plastic. But, yes, what a poorly and shamefully manufactured product!<br /><br />The remote now looks somewhat odd without its backing … but I fail to see why this backing is necessary in the first place, and its chemical odor is still worrying my mind! The remote control itself continues to work perfectly and now that its horrible backing is removed, it could possibly earn a four or five star rating from my family! But, no, my low rating is meant to serve you by providing warning!e molded-plastic backing had begun a process of FALLING APART.

"This product has two flaws - each is individually puzzling as a design choice, and the combination of the two makes the device defective.<br /><br />(1) The shape of this dock suggests that it has a recessed slot that the iPad or iPhone sits in, and that holds the device in place while docked. However, this gap is practically cavernous - it is so oversized that it doesn't hold the device at all. It is also so shallow that even if you lean an iPad way back to make contact with it, the contact point is way at the bottom, so it will fall over. As a result, the device is only supported by standing on the Lightning connector.<br /><br />Besides being disappointing, this flaw is problematic for several reasons. First, frankly, any device that's not gigantically sized will look ridiculous, standing in the middle of this huge hole. It's probably intentional that none of the photos for this product at Amazon show the dock with a device attached - see the one that I attached to this review to understand how pathetic it looks. Second, any dock that supports the device only by standing on the dock connector will put strain on the Lightning port *and* the connector: over time, one or both will be damaged. Third, because the Lightning connector is fairly short, the device is really unstable - perhaps not bad for an iPhone, but an iPad will not be secure at all.<br /><br />So that's bad, but it gets worse, because:<br /><br />(2) The socket that holds the Lightning connector has some wiggle room, so it can pivot forward and backward. So the dock doesn't feature a fixed prong upon which you can stand the device; rather, you have fuss with the connector to get it into the port on the bottom of the device. This is just a very strange choice for a dock connector; I can't even imagine a reason for this design.<br /><br />When you put these flaws together, what you get is a port that's not only frustrating to connect, but also provides little support for the device.<br /><br />Try this:Take an ordinary Lightning cable; bend the connector part upward and set it on a table; then take your device with both hands, and try to mount it on the totally unsupported Lightning cable. Nearly impossible, right? That's what this device does, only it costs $60.",negative

Although it was hard to find, I also like that its not easy to turn the device off.",positive
"Pros: Sounds better than expected for this price...setup easy...manual fairly complicated, could be much better explained to the average user and I consider myself somewhat above average in electronic setups.  It's a nice looking unit with loads of features.<br /><br />Con:  Among the features I was looking forward to using  is the wi-fi audio streaming.  For awhile it worked and sounded great, however after a couple weeks use it would drop the wi-fi signal and the only way to bring it back was to turn of the unit and reboot.  The signal first started dropping out at a little over an hour and steadily fell to about 15 minutes.  Therefore, this unit goes back tomorrow for a replacement unit and hopefully the problem does not repeat itself  because I really like this receiver other than the wi-fi problem.  Otherwise I'll be buying another Yamaha, my previous two receivers.  One more note...I did call Onkyo tech support and they advised to return to return the unit.<br /><br />This would be a 5 star rating if it were not for the wi-fi issue..it that's not important to you, I think you'd like it just fine.",negative
"3 stars for me experience in using this cable with XBOX ONE / ADAPTER My question is posted , I Posted a 2nd question  [ SUMMARY ] everything works fine with only the StarTech.com Headset adapter for headsets with separate headphone / microphone plugs - 3.5mm 4 position to 2x 3 position 3.5mm M/F Plugged in http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SP0WAQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00  but when I plug in this extension other people say they hear their own voice in echo.. this is only when I have the extension plugged into the controller/adapter then into the startech splitter and out to my mic and headphones.  I'm thinking it has to be something to do with the cable seeing as it only happens when it's plugged in.

That said, these have great sound for the price. I have never been one to use the speaker functionality with my phone very often but it seems to work just fine.<br /><br />These tangle just as much as other tangle-resistant earbuds, sorry.",positive
This little thing is pretty loud. It's a good speaker for the price. Had to replace mine which somehow broke.,positive
This completed by needs for battery chargers.<br />Thanks.  lMilt,positive
This did not work at all with  my location. Have to return,negative
This worked fine but it will not fit with the kids version case! It worked but I had to return it.,positive
Good the price. I can not wear them as long as i would like... hurt my ears after a prolong usage.,positive
"I'm gonna try to make this short and sweet...<br /><br />This is a GREAT speaker for SMALLER areas. I purchased this because I wanted to use it at a birthday party on about a 1/2 acre, with about 20 people. You could hear it, but it wasn't as loud as it was when I turned it on inside (which was loud as all get out! 'Bout busted an ear drum... lol!) I could hear it pretty decently in the backyard, but you couldn't hear it at all if I turned the corner to go into the front yard (which I'm sure my neighbors were happy about.) I like the fact that it is water resistant, the battery life on this thing lasts what feels like FOREVER, it connects easily to bluetooth, it has a volume up/down button, a left/right button (for changing it to the next song - works with Pandora, too!) I mean truly... this thing is a BEAST. 10 year olds were dropping it all over the place and it hasn't made a dent or scratch or anything...<br /><br />The only reason I give it 4 stars, is because I wish it were a little louder for outdoor gatherings... but regardless, it's a great speaker for the price and it got the job done.",positive
"I ordered these half expecting that they would take over a week to ship, but they actually arrived the day after I ordered them! I've always had a problem with earbuds because they never actually stay in my ears and when I tried these they were PERFECT!! They don't fall out and they're very comfortable.

"Thought I would try Philips DVD-DL 8.5 Brand;  I have had 6 coasters with this media. Not impressed and a little annoyed.<br />Usually Use Optical Quantam brand, never had a coaster with that brand. Can't recommend Philips",positive
"Great, accurate sound. They do not have overly boosted-base or treble... just crystal-clear, even reproduction.  Obviously if deep bass performance is your thing, you should consider a larger woofer size or a 2.1 system. But this price and size, these are really impressive.  UPDATE: After a year of use, the &#34;Powered Speaker Position Selector&#34; switch is failing, which results in only the non-powered channel playing. If I jiggle it a bit, I can get both channels working, but this is temporary... as the &#34;powered&#34; speaker will stop playing within a day or two.  It's pretty disappointing that a very impressive product is crippled by using cheap components.",positive
"Bought one of these for my son as he moved into his first apartment. Trying to make ends meet he did not want to spring for cable.  Hooked it up to his TV and ran the auto channel selection from his setup menu. It took several minutes and found about 40 channels, most digital.  It did find a couple of audio/music channels too.  Obviously you are not going to get ESPN or HBO but you can the local networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox and assorted public stations, plus some odd ones I had not heard of.  All-in-all works well and a good product for the price.",positive
Product stopped working after a month of daily running and water damage due to sweating. This is a known issue. Apple/Beats solution is for the consumer to send the product to Apple/Beats and wait to hear back. This is an unacceptable solution for a product advertised as water resistant and at a cost of ~$200. Read all the reviews before buying.,negative
"The cable works, but it's a poor quality cable. The signal gets degraded at this length. I needed some long cable to hook up my 7.1 rear speakers, but they were too quiet. I can barely hear them at normal volume.",negative
Seems to be made well. It is a little larger than it needs to be for the earphone headpiece I have.,negative
The picture quality is garbage. And the second screen barely works and the speaker's don't work. I would like to find the person that sent me this garbage. Or Broke Garbage.,positive
They are too large for 12&#34; records..the sleeves are 12.5 inches...not standard size! Shipping and price were good of this is what you are looking for,positive
Love it but it only plays for no more than a half hour then battery low. Charged over night still will not hold a charge. Also while listening to radio function for a short while starts saying Bluetooth ready to pair.If I can not figure out the problem I will be returning the item,positive
"Pretty sturdy tv mount. I already mounted my 50&#34; to the wall and it looks nice. Only thing is that the tv is so close to the wall that I cant plugin HDMI cables need an elbow. So, make sure to purchase elbows for the extra components that connect from the back.",negative
"This thing takes forever to charge something, but it does eventually.<br /> I used it for a portable dvd player that I lost the wall plug to.<br />The company wanted 40 bucks for a charger, and that wasn't going to happen so I bought this.<br />It took about 8 hrs to charge my dvd player using the auto plug that came with the dvd player.<br />Just be warned, it takes a very long time to charge so plan ahead ahead when you need it!",positive

Used them for a couple of weeks and one of the ear buds stopped working as well as the mic,positive
Loses charge even if it is not used...good for the price though.,positive
"Good- It appears to be fairly durable; it is lightweight and good for running (too many of these are too bulky). Decent sound<br /><br />Bad- For me, it was slightly too bad and the earpieces hung a little low on my ears, which impacted the sound and made them uncomfortable (especially since I use them on runs). But that could just be me (or a small subsection of people). As far as I can tell you can't adjust them, which is par for the course for bluetooth headsets with this design.",positive
Cleans my gold and silver well.  I use it with a mild jewelry cleaner detergent and water. Everything sparkles... Only takes about 3 mins to run one cycle.  Love it...,positive
Had trouble with it detecting some video signals in auto mode but overall it does what it should.,negative
"This headphones sound great overall, the bass is not that pronunced but it sounds nice and clear, i use them with my nexus 6 and i have had no problema at all.<br /><br />The only inconvenience is that there are not that confortable to use for prolongue times ( 2 or more hours), but for the price i grabbed them (80 USD) this simply cannot be matched.",positive
"Cheap, bit I prefer the fit and sound to the higher priced Sony's. Their rubber cups fit better than these silicone cups.",negative
"They were okay, nothing special and actually I don't even use them anymore...",positive
"These work well except for biking on a noisy bike trail.  I use them while commuting via a seperated bike trail that runs next to a 4 lane road.  When going at over 17 mph on my bike, the combination of wind and traffic noise the ear buds let in makes it difficult to hear anything on my Ipod without turning the volume up to what might be dangerously high levels.  They do seem to stay in my ears pretty well even when wet with sweat.",negative
It was rattling and Was broke In pieces before I even opened it. I tried it and it did nothing. It said to leave it play in VCR for 20sec yet kept spitting it out. I'm going to return it. Hopefully i don't have to pay for shipping!,positive
"You know when you touch a product and it just feels like good quality?  Well, that's what I felt with this mount.  The packaging was heavy-duty, the HDMI cable included was neat, and the LED light was a nice extra touch.  I especially liked how the safety toggles engage automatically and can be disengaged by pulling on the strings.  Quality product.  I had this mount put together and on the wall in a matter of 15 minutes.  It definitely beats paying $90 for a mount from Home Depot or Walmart.",positive
"Defective. Even after being fully charged, speaker still keeps making a beep-beep sound every few seconds, whether it's playing music or not. Returning to Amazon.",positive
"I have an iPhone 6, and the headphones that came with it were just fine... until I dropped the phone and the cord broke. In the past I've bought headphones that were a bit cheap, and wanted to find a pair that looked good, didn't tangle and had good sound.<br /><br />Since I've been using these the past few weeks, it's lived up to expectations. The sound is really good - both my hearing and how those on the other end can hear me without effort. No crackling or problems at all. If anything, I think the microphone pics up a bit much of ambient noise (as opposed to just my voice, so doing dishes or such means I need to put them on mute - but I'd rather do that than have them not hear me! Definitely recommended",negative
"Had it delivered on a Saturday and returned the same day. I was very disappointed with this after reading the reviews, the fugoo sounded like the best speaker ever made, for sound which is the key of a speaker; there is better available at that price point. However, and the big but here is for the water proof/ resistant speakers out there ( this one is tested water proof) you can't find anything like it. My biggest problem was the bass. After hearing a bose mini soundlink II, there's no going back. Pros/cons listed below strictly my opinion.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Clean highs<br />Above average mids<br />360 sound<br />Loud enough* after firmware update.<br />100% water dust mud etc proof.<br />Pretty stylish, pun intended.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bass - main reason I returned honestly.<br />Minor distortion above 75-80% volume - I noticed this, others didn't...? Opinion based of course. Based in hearing.<br /><br />Again I had some cheap speaker and then listened to a friends bose SLII for an entire weekend. Being waterproof was a plus but for me speakers sound be about sound.... Compared the two side by side and clear winner is the bose.",positive
"Sound quality is okay. Same quality you would get if you bought a cheap pair of $5 earphones. It cannot get better quality because the ear part fits right on your ears and not over them to give you that surround sound effect. As for the headband part, it fits on adult head, but the band rests just on top of my head and does not fit snug all around it. So imagine the headphones as a circle and cut an opening where the ears are supposed to connect, so you end up with a semicicle on your head with ears. This is what it looks like on me. What it should look like in the picture with the girl wearing them on the box is not real. It does not look like this on your head. The cord broke without me even using it. I just received it and there is a plastic bit on the cord, for who knows what reason, and it came off exposing some wires. Mind you, things like this generally don't happen to me where things break right as you receive them as I am not banging them around. I simply just took it out of the box and  put it on a table to use the next day. Next day I realize the wire is exposed and the piece of plastic that was supposed to be covering the wire was just on the table. I bought the bear ones and they look exactly as pictured. It is all fur and adjustable.  Update: I bought this in July and it is now March. Sound only comes out of one ear now. Had to dump. It didn't last a year, but was ok.",negative
"This is the only sport headphone that will stay when I run.  The only downside is that, as someone who runs with a ponytail, the bouncing of my ponytail on the wraparound part makes a very distinctive sound and can be heard over the music at any level.  I don't remember this being a problem with the previous version of this headphone.",negative
"Very good headphones for sound but not as much so for comfort. The little pads on top are very hard and you need to mess with them alot so there not just poking your head, but it feels like if you mess with them to much then might break off.",positive
"To start off, my headphone credentials are not that of an &#34;audiophile&#34; but I listen to music almost every day on multiple sets of headphones. In the past I have owned the Beats studio HD (1st edition), Beats in-ear headphones, Skullcandy Skull Crushers, Beats Mixrs, Bose QC15, Powerbeats wireless, and the Beats Studio Wireless. Of that list of headphones, I was never satisfied with a pair of headphones until the Bose. Both pairs of Beats had just &#34;eh&#34; sound and terrible build quality. Both pairs were broken, replaced, and returned at least once until I bought the Bose close to 6 years ago. Unfortunately, the headphones finally showed they were made of earthly materials as the speakers began to crackle and fade. After a couple weeks of research, I finally decided to take a leap of faith and go with another pair of Beats. I recently purchased the Powerbeats wireless and they really made me re-evaluate my opinion of Beats. Whether it was the buyout by Apple or years of negative reviews, it seems as if the company finally decided to make a change. Now that I've had the Studios for a few days, I figured I'd share my first opinions:<br /><br />Build:<br />Much better than the 1st edition of the headphones, as they feel much more solid and a lot less plastic feel. The outer layer feels like a metal substance while all clasps/enclosures feel like metal as well. The ear cushions are made of a comfortable and soft leather. The headband is a simple rubber band with a little air pocket/pad inside. This is the main area for concern for me as this was the big problem I had in Beats past, but only time will tell.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />One of, if not the main reason I gave the product 4 stars. The materials used are solid as listed above, but the total weight of the product is definitely felt after a little while of usage. The headband is the biggest problem so far, as it feels like someone is pressing their thumb to the top of your skull while you wear them. I've found a few different areas on the top of my head that are a little more comfortable, but regardless I find myself adjusting them every 20 minutes or so. The ear cushions are a nicer feeling leather but aren't big or deep enough to completely encase your ears. It isn't noticeable until a half hour or so, but the combination of the small ear holes and how the speakers stick out to the point they touch your ears, leaves your ears hot and hurting. While this may not be as big as a problem for some people, I'm used to the extreme comfort of the Bose QC 15's which aren't noticeable after 6 hours of use.<br /><br />Sound:<br />Like I said, I'm not the most qualified to give a review on sound, but I know enough and have heard enough headphones to understand the difference in sound and quality. This is where Beats truly surprised me. The first generation headphones were nothing more than mediocre which caused waves of negative reviews. In the second outing by Beats, they really stepped up their game and put out a pair of headphones that are well balanced through the lows, mids, and highs. With the Bose, I always felt like there was something missing with the lows, and Beats really did a good job bringing down the low levels and balancing them out. Overall they do sound a little heavy, but the mids and highs are still crisp and evident whether listening to classic music or watching movies.<br /><br />Wireless:<br />The main reason I went with the Beats Wireless. The Powerbeats wireless made me realize how annoying wires can be especially moving around or doing something as simple as laying in bed. The bluetooth works well and smoothly with minimal problems so far. The headphones quickly recognize the last device you were using with them and transition to another device quickly. Definitely puts the product above the competition.<br /><br />Noise Canceling:<br />Nothing special here. The noise canceling isn't very noticeable compared to the QC15's which are still the best noise canceling for the price out there. I really do wish there was an option to use the headphones without noise canceling to save battery but then the sound quality would probably go down as well. The noise canceling in these headphones is by no means something to brag about, but a nice feature as it most likely improves audio quality etc.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I've had the headphones for only a few days, but I really enjoy them. The big thing to me is the price. I was able to score these for 225 new on a prime deal. For 380, I wouldn't buy them. I put them at the 300 price range like the Bose or non-wireless Studios, but for 225, it was definitely a steal. The sound of the headphone, to me, was and upgrade from the Bose, but the comfort and lack of noise canceling was definitely a let down for sure. I didn't expect the noise canceling to be anything near Bose (which make those the great headphones they are), but the comfort was a big turn off for the headphones. The overall build of the headphones was a nice surprise, but the big win in these headphones was the wireless feature. I loved my Bose and would buy another pair if the price were the same as these, but the lack of wireless really was annoying at times especially when I have a life proof case which means you have to use an adapter to even use the headphones. The wireless means no adapter and no wires. All in all, the headphones were an amazing buy for the price, and if you can buy them for anything near (I saw the blue pair was around 260) they're definitely worth it, but unfortunately I had to give them 4 stars solely for the discomfort I have when wearing them.",negative
"Cheap and flimsy, poor connection from wire to plug.",negative
"Stay away from these headphones. They are way overpriced and the outer shell is made from a cheap, brittle plastic. After 3 months of minimal usage, the plastic above the ear cup started to crack on both sides. I contacted Apple Support and was told the only option I had was to pay $200 to have them replaced. These headphones are a piece of junk and Apple knows this. They will not stand behind their product.",negative
Convenient for those who have an extra pair of headphones with them and do not feel like sharing their own.,positive
"I must have very small ear openings because I have a problem getting these in and to stay in.  If they're not in correctly the sound is tinny.  As far as noise cancelling I wouldn't know since they don't fit and this is about the tenth pair of earbuds I've tried.  On a good note, it comes with a nice case and several size earbuds for the hard to fit ears, unfortunately not mine.",positive
Interchanged with my RV Dish so I could just use one cable.  Be sure and get the external power supply required for SWM dishes though.,positive
Reception is great and I live in an apartment in a medium sized city. Easy set-up. Only 4 stars because I had to purchase another one because the connector on the back of it broke off the 1st one I had purchase within 9 months. Hopefully this one will last longer.,positive
The leads are made  too short to save a penny!  They will not reach the connecting posts on most antennas even if you split the twin lead.  Keep shopping.,negative
"The quality is good, but one side of the headphones is not working and the cover of the ear muff is coming off. This is after six months of use. If you still decide to buy it, purchase a warranty.",positive
Great product. Worked great in Italy. Used for iPhones and iPads. Quality was good nice and sturdy,positive
"I use this every time I travel.  It's compact, has a built-in USB charger, and three outlets.  This is especially useful if you're going to another country and only want to have to keep track of one international adapter (these don't come with it, but Amazon has them).",positive
"Exceptional batteries that hold their charge for a long time when stored. They charge quickly and fully.  I use them for everything. When my trackpad says the batteries are low to the outdoor backup lights and remote controls.  I haven't bought a single over the counter battery AAA since I bought these guys. Efficient, long lasting and powerful.",positive
"Good product for the cost. Had to purchase higher quality HDMI cables in order for my devices to play through. Sound is decent, can't complain with how inexpensive the product was.",positive
I've purchased these before and bought these to replace a pair that I had a couple of years. This one lasted 2 months. The microphone has stopped working and the remote that controls the volume and playback are stuck and I can't raise or lower it.,negative
"Keep in mind that this is an extension cable, not a full service cable. . . ie. it's a female/male not male/male. You will need a male/male cable to pair with this extension.<br /><br />Zeskit sells a 4' male/male for under $10 which pairs well given that it has the same metallic material. The gold plated connectors snap in with ease and provide clear audio. Having an extender makes things a little easier but the big thing here is the braided nylon does a great job keeping the long cables tangle free.<br /><br />I was provided this product in exchange for a fair review. I will continue to use this product and will report back with any issues.<br /><br />thank you for reading!",positive
Its exactly the item I requested and works perfectly the only disparity  I have is the length of the cord is a little to short in terms of distance from the plug.,positive
"Disappointing after reading all those rave reviews. I understand that the most important thing to get right is the seal in the ear. Unfortunately, with or without the accompanying earphone covers, I wasn't able to get a good seal. Any attempt to get the sound right leads to either an uncomfortable fit or an unstable seating. The fit that works naturally for me has high volume, some noise, weakish bass and generally lower performance compared to an apple earpod (which isn't that great, to begin with).<br /><br />To add to the woes, volume control doesn't work with my iPhone 6. I guess this would be a wasted purchase though I might give it a few more days to burn. My search for a good not-in-ear earbuds continue. Would be glad to get any other recommendation. Please do help! :)",positive
"This SGP5.0 is just ok, Could have been better if Samsung updated the units Gingerbread Operating system. The camera is not that great and not that terrible. As a game device, 512k ram in not sufficient. heavy graphics game slows down terribly but PVZ1 is quite alright. I just use it to past time and served its purpose. What is quite fun is the OS Dev for this unit. it is quite an experience.. I learned a lot from Android its development, the way the security improved over time.",negative
So easy to use. I just wish they also sold these as molded pairs.,positive
"They don't have much range away from the source. If you don't have them placed a certain way on your head then they're uncomfortable. They're not sweat proof because I've been using them while riding my bike. I actually thought I was ordering the Marathon2's again which are great for bike riding and other sport activities. To be fair though, the Amazon-basics are good for use at work while I'm just sitting at my desk and don't have to move much because I believe they disconnect more often then they should (there is no battery low warning)...",positive
"Cord is far too short, it isn't comfortable to wear, and the bass feels weirdly disconnected... I ended up selling it to one of my idiot friends.",positive
Not round enough for some vape pens. my ultrafire ones work better!,negative
"I'm am not a electrician and don't know much about electronics all I know it's that I gave this outlet a 5 rating because I have not had any problem at all. It has 4 outlet plugs and 4 USB plugs. I love it because it makes my table more clean and easy access to plugs. Making more space for my table.  I come in white and silver colors. It is hard great quality plastic. It feels good on my hand , soft hard plastic. It looks elegant on my table.  The 4 outlets ports work great I can plug many things at once. And I have not had any problem at all. The USB ports work fine I leave my plugs on and no problem at all.  My favorite part is that it includes 4 USB ports it makes it easy for me to plug my phone and iPad. I'm always searching for extra USB plugs. It won't come off like and all work fine with all my electronics. For me this is a great product and I know it will last me a very long time.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest unbaised opinion.",positive
"Excellent sound quality using comply foam tips, but after only a week the tips became squishy and unusable. Also one o the cords messed up, and two weeks later the other cable completely broke. While these sound good the build quality is severely lacking. instead o reordering another pair i'm going to pick up the shure se215 special edition. they last longer. so if you buy these don't expect them to hold up long. :(",positive
"They sound amazing, but for some reason are incredibly uncomfortable for me.  They come with two sizes of the silicone end-pieces, and switching to the smaller ones definitely helped.  Still I can only wear them for an hour or two at a time before I have to give my ears a break.  I dunno, maybe I have freakishly tiny ear holes or something.<br /><br />BTW if it matters to you, the red phones are a bit on the pink side.  I don't give a hoot but I could see a 12 year old kid making a deal of it, I guess.",positive
"the cover does it's job well.  however, be aware this only covers the front of the tv, and if against a wall it's fine. mine is sort of a temporary set up on the patio and can possibly get wet in a high wind.  a cover that slips over the entire tv would be ideal.",negative
The floppy drive looked old and dusty plus the case it's enclosed in didn't stay snapped together -- it did power up at least but was sold as new in box.,positive
Worked great! Easy to hook up. Could use better instructions though. You need to be intuitive to know that if blue light is on inside box... You don't have receiver plug pushed in far enough. Other than that. Very good.,positive
"Love the sound (very natural, I think), pretty good isolation, they seem to be pretty durable, but they fit really tight, they're very heavy and cause pain to the ears and neck after a while. When I'm working for long periods on music at my computer, I find myself having to take breaks from them.<br /><br />There's no beating the look, though. As cool as it gets.",positive
"They work, but not great.  Got my pair in December, and last night both of them junked out.  Unable to charge them fully now.  They always discharged too fast anyway.  20A continuous, not 35A, of course.  Better than a sharp stick in the eye, but there are better batteries out there.<br /><br />Just ordered some LG HE4s as replacements.",positive
"This is a wonderful product from Onkyo, and it's not expensive for me. Best earphone",positive
Does not work well.  Buttons do not respond when pushed.  Would not buy it again.,negative
"Maybe I got a bad unit. Seems to have good sound, volume is decent but does not top out at a very loud setting.<br /><br />Two stars because my unit would randomly unpair from the phone playing the music. Frustrating enough that I'm returning it.",negative
It has two adjustable blades that cut at 1/4 inch spacing. (see attached photos) I used it in combination with PPC Ex6xlPlus Rg6 Snap & Seal Outdoor Coax Compression Connectors. It made adding the connector quick and easy.,positive
Well thus far I'm not impressed. I just opened the box and washers and bolts were scattered throughout the box. I have no idea if I have all of the parts I need. Also there were no instructions in the box and the level that is suppose to be on the wall plate is not there. I also had to put back together one of the adjustable arms. This was probably a returned item and they didn't bother to check if everything was still there. Disappointed to say the least.,negative
The sound is great and the headset is very comfortable to wear.,positive
This product is no good i got it began to use it and it is no good now i have to replace it cause the wire breaks every time I peel it. Not a good item to get,positive
"I guess these headphones aren't the worst made, so they may not deserve 1 star. But positive reviews are so extreme nowadays, giving pretty good products 5-stars, I rated them this way to balance things out. I am not an audiophile, but I enjoy music very much. It's hard to know which earbuds to choose, since you really can't try before you buy. I am pretty happy with the Panasonic buds that were about $7, but I wanted to spend a bit more money to see if I could find sound a little better, richer.  These are definitely not better; instead much worse. They are heavy on the bass, but the bass sounds like it's coming from the blown out subwoofer cranked to 10 in a 16-year-old's car.  All other frequencies are just muddled. I'd love to find a really nice set of buds for about $50 - buds that sound significantly better than the Panasonics. these are definitely not the ones.",positive
Worked out the box with my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS OS as well as my Raspberry Pi and my BeagleBone black. The quality is not the best but suited by needs for my robotics project.,positive
"The alarm clock is no louder then one you buy at the store. However, the flashing lights and the bed shaker are pretty cool. My heavy sleeper still sleeps through it.",negative
"Come as it states. Nothing special, as these are just connectors...",negative
"Overall, the system is good. The sound is decent, but sometimes there is static noise (interference) when you least expect it. In addition, there is no indicator to show when the battery is fully charged. All in all, I am pleased with the system. It's simple to operate, very portable and the battery life is good.",positive
I tried to use this with the elgato game capture but it didn't work,positive
very suitable to purpose... found that putting the speaker in corner of room gave a bigger sound... very nice product.,negative
Does the job. Okay quality but nothing spectacular. I expected more.,negative
"Received as a gift, was surprised at how punchy and clean the bass is, and how good the sound quality is over-all. I always have the bass bazuca on because I just like to have more bass in most everything I listen to. If you want a good music system with some punchy bass, that doesn't cost you an arm and a leg, than try this out. Only con is that the buttons on actual receiver on the unit can take a few seconds, or just not work at all. Though the remote works very well.",positive
awful alarm clock. blue back light doesn't stay on and batteries run out very quickly.,positive
Great! Exactly as described. Good price and shipping.,positive
Works great! Just like new. But I can't tell the difference from this one and the $18 generic bulb I bought 3 years ago. Not with the premium spent.,positive
PRODUCT FOR THE MOST PART &#34;AS DESCRIBED&#34; BUT LACKS IN STRENGTH FOR OLDER MODEL TVS.,positive
"Great female vocals and resolution, female vocal is forward and refined. Not much bass though, especially at the low end",positive
"OK so far.  The previous one w/ a lower wattage rating burned out and was not that old.  If you're considering, go for a higher wattage Pyle.  I think it'll be worth your while.",negative
"Great Velcro .. I use them to tie cables all the time.<br /><br />Excellent seller! FAST shipping, HIGHLY recommended! Thank you! AAA+++",positive
"Nice brackets. Only improvement I would recommend is having some type of spacer for the bottom of the brackets where they meet the TV. Sound bar is pretty wobbly when touched. Can easily make something to correct this. Other than that, great mount.",positive
"I have used it several times, and connect very easily with blue-tooth. The sound is quite good for the size,and is convenient to take with you where ever you go . The main thing I don''t like is that when you turn it on and connect to it is always comes on at full volume and you have to quickly turn it down.",positive
"After 4 months of daily use, it's still going strong. It sounds pretty good(especially in the shower) and the Bluetooth has never had an issue. I just wish it had a radio built in.",positive
(Xbox one) I was haveing trouble with it at first but the I realized that the hdmi cable also works a power divice so I removed the cord that came with it and I repluge everything and once I turned on my Xbox one the hdmi started to give power to it and that should fix your issue.<br /><br />Steps:<br />1)turn on Xbox<br />2)take off hdmi of Xbox<br />3) put back hdmi on Xbox<br />4) should be good to go,positive
"I got a bad apple: it worked fabulously for 30 minutes, then refused to turn on as other reviews pointed out. I am returning the item to the 3rd party fulfilled by amazon (R and B Distributors INC) for refund, and ordering one directly from amazon. the sound is loud, and base is decent from such a tiny unit (louder and better sound than iPhone 4), the light is bright enough at dimmer room. I wish more pattern from the light.",negative
I have used this cable for a couple of years now and it still works great,positive
Worked great for about a year. then completely stopped working.,positive
"This is NOT white as in description.  It is actually clear, which is not what I wanted.  Had to return.",negative
"These types of UPS's aren't meant to power anything big(tv, stereo, home computer, etc.)for any USEFUL length of time, but work good for smaller components during a power outage. I have my modem router plugged into the battery backup and it kept it powered on during a recent outage so my laptop, tablet, and smart phone kept getting internet connection and I could watch a movie during the outage on my laptop.<br />  I'm sure the power surge protection works fine but during lightning I would unplug it. Like any power strip, no way can it protect against the massive electrical surge that a lightning strike can put out.",positive
We have taken this speaker everywhere.  We even used it as an outdoor movie speaker in our backyard.  Its loud enough to hear but no too loud that it would annoy our neighbors.,negative
"I needed a couple of short HDMI cables to connect components to a switching unit.  Obviously the cables needed to be flexible since the length was so short.  I am really happy with these cables.  They are flexible, but still are of a very good quality.  The connectors seem to be very well made.  Well worth the price!",positive
Love this clock.  I received one from work for an anniversary gift for my years of service and I wanted another one just like it.,positive
"These are OK for the $20 price, but could be better. The short cable between the 2 ear pieces make these best for small-to-medium sized heads. I wear a size 7.5 hat (large, but not extra large) and the cable is too short to wrap around my ears like the advertising photo shows. Sound quality is only average with less clarity than in-ear type Bluetooth earbuds (available for about the same price on Amazon), though this type of headphone that doesn't fit all the way in your ear may be more comfortable for some people.<br /><br />On the plus side, this headset pairs easily with my phone and is very compact and easy to store (unlike headphones with long wires that are always tangling or snagging). No case is included, however.",positive
The quality of sound was great but these headphones are too big and bulky to use comfortably everyday.,positive
"Simple to install, good quality - makes powering your Roku far simpler - no long cable and/or &#34;wall wart&#34; power supply to hide.  Power to your Roku is turned on or off with your HDTV.  Sweet!",positive
This product is terrible. It got tangled and i inraveled it and it broke,negative
The item after using the iphone dock only 3 times is now broken.,negative
"Definitely some shady selling going on here. No rba deck, no quad coil, only has one tank protector (should be two), no spare seals, screws or pyrex. Definitely not worth the price when for the same amount you can get the full kit.",negative
"So far the UPS works well.  I have been using the front USB ports to keep my tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2) and my iPhone 5 charged while I'm working on the computer. It worked fine for a few days, but it started to cut power when my iPhone battery was low (tablet was on standby). My guess is that it went over the 1A limit for the USB.<br /><br />Other than that, it has worked great. It effortlessly runs my desktop and two monitors, which surprisingly only pull at most 210W.<br /><br />CyberPower said that the screen cannot be kept on. I found if I held the Display button down for a few seconds, the unit beeped and the screen has remained on since. They claim that the screen life will be decreased, but it's LCD (like a watch or clock) with an LED backlight. I'm not concerned with screen life.",positive
The sound is great but it stopped working after a month. I tried to call Altec and there has no response. Also when you charge the speaker a loud voice comes and is annoying.,positive
"Sturdy little device, sounds alright for what it is.  Headphones a bit awkward but I have never enjoyed wearing the over-the-ear style but while you are swimming it makes sense they should be shaped this way to hold their place.",positive
"FOR THE PRICE, the sound quality is great. Comfort is ok, but I can only handle them in-ear for about 1 hour. I've owned Bose headphones before and the difference is astronomical, but if you're someone who loses headphones easily (like me), it's not a bad pair to pick up.",positive
"exceptional for the price, replaced the tips with &#34;Veritas Memory Foam Earphone Tips Foam Tips&#34; (Fits 2.5mm-3.5mm) found here in Amazon<br />and sound never felt any better, Earlier i bought the same but for android. you can also add &#34;ITIS 5Pcs Headphone Headset Cable Cord Clip Holder&#34; to properly hung on the shirt.<br /><br />Edit: a year later sound stopped from the right channel, only used them an hour three times a week, they are cable in excellent condition and no sign of wear or tear. so i'm modifying my review and given them 2 stars, nonetheless bought another set, cause i really liked their sound.",positive
"Unfortunately, this broke in under 2 months, as some of the other reviews claimed. But I didn't listen. Doh! I bought it for light use. Just listening to audio CDs from the library. No heavy wear and tear at all. It just blanked out and stopped working one day. I ended up getting a different brand at Best Buy for about the same price. I also bought the cheap $5 2yr. Warranty. So far, no issues. Cheap archaic technology. Whattaya gonna do. Lol.",positive
Really solid and nice tool. I don't think this works with headphones that have microphones. Which royally sucks! Tried with multiple headphones with mics and 2 different computers with mics. NO GO BUMMER.,positive
Beware I was fooled with all the positive reviews for this device. Closer inspection reveals they are all within the last 30 days and by many who sound the same...this device was not intuitive and the instructions were in poor English. It would not connect to my laptop running windows 8.1 but it did connect to my Mac desktop although every time I disconnected and re-connected it sounded terrible until I re-installed the device. It is going back...,negative
"This bracket is heavy duty.  It's installed, working and I have no intentions of returning it, or purchasing a different bracket.  Here's my take of what I liked (a lot) and didn't like (a little):<br /><br />Pros<br />- This thing is Heavy Duty, there is nothing cheap about the metal (or the finish) that makes up the bracket and arm.<br />- There are four serious lag screws to anchor in masonry or wood studs.<br />- There is a LOT of hardware that comes with the bracket, and it is clearly labeled.  There are extra bolts, washers and spacers of various sizes - it's hard to imagine a TV that could not be installed with the various hardware provided.<br />- The instructions are much better than average for a &#34;low tech&#34; product like this.  They are thorough and written clearly.  There are instructions for small, large and odd shaped TV installations, and I had no problem understanding the directions.<br />- I thought the self-adhesive bubble level would be gimmicky, but it's easy to use and worked well.  The mounting template was useful and thick enough to tape to the wall without tearing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Once the bracket/arm is installed on the wall, and the adjustable bracket is installed on the back of the TV, the instructions indicate it might take two people to put the two together for the final installation.  Well, it took three of us for our wall mounted application about 4 feet off the ground.  The TV has to be held still for the left and right, top and bottom bolts/washers to be installed.  Even with the arm extended, it's tight behind the TV, and I cannot imagine trying to do this installation with only two people.<br />- The bracket allows for a -5 to 15 degree vertical plane adjustment.  We wanted ours at 0 (parallel to the wall) - to keep it at 0, we had to tighten the spring loaded adjustment arm/bolt and the corresponding top installation bolt VERY TIGHT.  Otherwise, the weight of the TV (nothing unusual - normal Wal-Mart Samsung) kept tilting the bracket forward.<br /><br />All in all, we are completely satisfied.",negative
"Great, well made cable. Amazon Basics are the best products for the money. You can't go wrong with their electronics products.",positive
Its great for my small apartment and rooftop. Its still a bit heavy to carry on travels but still fits nicely in a carry on if you have room for some extra weight. The sound quality is great and the battery life is also good. Its gives 6 hrs of uninterrupted play on a single charge. But then its still quite new so I say that with a caveat. I initially thought it comes with a remote but it didn't. The bluetooth device (smart phone etc) acts as the remote duh!! :),positive
"Didn't fit my odd shaped monitor out the box, but $5 at Lowe's got me some spacers and longer screws to make it work. Saved me $50 from buying the OEM stand.<br /><br />To note, the included screws did fit just fine, but my screen had deep set holes for them that didn't work with the spacers that I needed to fit the mount around a bulge at the base of the screen.",negative
This AVR is pretty good it is the first one i have ever  purchase so i don't have anything to compare it to. I am a little confused about how to play my video from my phone to my tv. It said it had MLS or something like that but I still haven't got it to work. Also if you crack the sound up to high it will over heat and turn its self off. It would have been nice if Yamaha would have build a fan for this AVR to avoid this problem. So i use a little cheap clip on fan it has been working great now .,positive
"Great sound quality, but contrary to what the title says there is no MIC on these headphones",positive
Stopped working after one day. Could have been this particular unit but I will look to another brand for my next purchase.,negative
"I loved this remote when we got it, but less than a year in and it no longer works.  The remote keeps losing its pairing with the hub (on a daily basis) and the only way to pair it up is to make some kind of configuration change.  Really disappointed.  Expect more longevity from this kind of product.",positive
"Bought it new 9 months ago. When it works, it's OK, but not the quality of my last Yamaha receiver.<br />For the last 5 months, it shuts itself off in just a few minutes of playing. A small fan that I put on top could alleviate the problem, but only if I position it exactly right. Recently it gave up the ghost.<br /><br />I shipped it back to the Yamaha service center, 65 miles away. Cost me $75 to ship,<br />Kinda expensive for warranty service on a fairly new product.<br /><br />Not too happy, only bought it to upgrade to HDMI.",positive
"Bought one from Harman Kardon itself. The headband broke in just an hour of wear. Sound is good, but the treble is pretty high. I wore them while working out and my ears got pretty hot and I had to keep them off from alternate ears.",positive
Not impressed. I've listened to others in this price range and just didn't think the soundstage was good at all. Very narrow. They are neutral which I liked.,positive
"The sound is good, and it fits my ear. However, when I connect it with my iPhone, there is constant hiss sound in the background. Is this hissing problem normal to all bluetooth headphones?",negative
This product works well. My only complaint is that the plug-in cord is a little short to use on my bedroom TV. I ended up hooking it up in my son's room. It was able to give it just enough boost he no longer has to move the antenna around to get the channel he wants. Installation is super simple. Basically it's a plug and play. Or better yet a plug and watch.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.,negative
"Overall good experience, thanks.  Gets the job done.",positive
"Ey, they are okay. A little clunky and not very comfortable to wear",positive
[[ASIN:B00KZHDSLQ PCI-E Express X1 to Dual PCI Riser Extender Card]]<br />Could not be used because my pci card bumped into the power plug that is hard to see in the image. Unit is useless unless used with a short PCI.<br /><br />One Star,negative
The blocker seems to work as described but I wish it had an interface or screen for confirmation of blocked numbers.,positive
The headphones that came with this are not ok because they stick in the ear.  I like my headphones on my ear.  The item has the volume fixed to nine and I do not like this.,negative
"ORDER PLACED  April 6, 2015<br />TOTAL  $151.15<br />ORDER # 116-9906287-0057001<br />One side worked and one side don't. Wasted money!!!",negative
"This never worked, I will never recommend anyone to buy this, complete waste of time",positive
"3rd batch of coasters in a row. These used to be my go-to brand of DL discs, but recently, Memorex's quality control has gone down the toilet. That was the last time I will ever by Memorex discs.",positive
Very nice quality speaker but the 3 tone button doesn't work.,negative
"uhhhh. Really wanted to love these and was hoping the comments about the constant disconnects were exaggerated or wouldn't apply to me, however that wasn't the case. Tried these about 5 different times with constant drops in connection. Mostly disappointed when running on the treadmill, couldn't keep a connection with my phone in my pocket or on the tray on the treadmill about 2 feet from my head.<br /><br />I will say that everything else about these wireless headphones is phenomenal. The fit, management, sound quality, software/buttons...all were great, and I'm picky about sound quality and fit.<br /><br />Being a MEElec fan I'm hoping they re-issue a V2 of these addressing this concern and I would give them another shot, but as-is they are basically un-usable. I saw when I was returning mine today that the manufacturing has discontinued the item, hopefully they don't give up on it and just improve this one tiny(albeit very important)feature. They would be a definite 5 star item.<br />Now I don't know if i should play the waiting game or jump in on more expensive options...none of which I will like the fit quite as much as the x7 im sure.",negative
"I've been wanting some kind of sleep-headphone solution for a long time, and these do the job nicely. The band is very soft and the headphones are nice and thin. The sound quality is much better than I anticipated, and I really love being able to listen to music as I lie in bed without annoying earbuds which hurt my ears, fall out, and get tangled. I like that the band is wide enough to be pulled over the eyes as a sleep mask as well. The quality is good, and the little travel pouch is useful for taking them places. I really love that the cord is fabric and does not tangle! This would be terrific on an airplane as well, and I know I'll take this with me whenever I travel.<br /><br />My only downsides are that the band is fairly tight - I have a medium size head and it's just a bit too snug - and the cord is about 8 inches too short. It keeps pulling my phone off of the nightstand. I don't really like having my phone on the bed with me or right next to my head. So that's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Overall though, a great product that has made my nighttimes much more pleasant!!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.",positive
Looks like cheap....I hope it protects my electronics if I get a power surge....I will update if it ever fails to do so,positive
"Don't buy! After 1 year of use it slows down - does not forward fast, you need to wait 8 seconds to get the next music on your player.",negative
Awesome speaker..its so small with a powerful bass and sound...it it also lots beautiful with all the bling. I've received this product in exchange for an honest review,positive
Great price much cheaper if your willing to wait a few days,positive
Great quality speakers - enjoyed listening with a few of my devices! The only comment I have is that the connecting cable is a bit longer but that's all!,positive
"This receiver is an upgrade to my starter 5.1 Pioneer receiver. I can't speak the technical jargon but I was happy with the additional features like 2 zone speaker function, network connection for my Spotify, YPAO setup function, additional HDMI connection and sound customization. I also got it on sale for $319 that was an added bonus.<br />The only issue so far is the occasional picture loss due to the HDMI pass through. A few of the reviewers on here have also experienced. Apparently I have to invest heavily on HDMI cables which is a bit of a pain because the current cables are fine and worked well with my previous receiver.<br />Love the receiver but I'll give it a low 4 out of 5 for the HDMI glitch.",positive
"After a little over one year of light use the rechargeable battery was no longer &#34;rechargeable&#34;.  The battery is also not designed to be replaceable.<br />I had been happy with the sound and design, but now need to throw it away.  Sound and design mean nothing without a good battery!",positive
Item never worked. I ended up purchasing the Impact toslink switch. Works like a charm.,negative
"This is a review for the Bose SoundTrue Ultra in-ear headphones (charcoal color) designed for Samsung Android devices.<br /><br />These in-ear buds offer great, well balanced sound for any stereo music device, but they are designed to offer in-line controls and microphone support with Android phones, and surprisingly, they work with some Windows Phone devices as well.<br /><br />The buds come with small, medium, and large soft silicone tips that are easy to snap onto the in-ear speakers.  The tips also have a silicone flare that helps wedge the buds in your ear and keep them in place.  The flare is comfortable for extended use and it kept my buds in position while walking and jogging.  Given the flexibility of the silicone, I think they will fit in almost anyone’s ear.  The entire length of the cord is a little over 3 feet, from the input jack all the way to the end of a bud.  The thin leads from each bud eventually join at a hard plastic Y-piece before continuing to the jack.  That hard plastic Y seems durable and helps to maintain spacing as the thin left and right wires go up to your ears.  On the right lead, between the bud and the Y-piece, is a small plastic button panel.  It houses three buttons on the front side, and a mic input on the back.  The 1/8” jack has 3 standard connections for Left and Right stereo music, as well as the mic.  Altogether, the hardware is well designed, comfortable, durable, and sweat-proof.  The icing on the cake is the included stylish, convenient storage case that zips close.  The case isn’t exactly a hard shell, but it has some thick cardboard-like toughness to it that will protect your buds from any dangers they might encounter while buried in a backpack.<br /><br />The sound from these buds is well-balanced.  The lows and highs do not dominate, which results in a nice, dynamic blend of sound at soft and loud volume levels.  They don’t sound as good as my over-the-ear $250 Monster headphones, obviously, but for earbuds, they are at the top of the quality list.  These buds will work well for reproducing most types of music. There is no active noise canceling, but the silicone does an acceptable job of insulating your ears from outside noise.  The microphone performance is better than I expected, to be honest.  The normal resting position for the mic is down against your chest, but somehow the people on the other end of the phone call could still hear me.  The mic performance was very good in quiet, indoor rooms.  While outside jogging or in the car, the people on the other end of the call could still hear me, but they also heard quite a bit of background noise.  Still, the mic performance was as good as could be expected for this type of hardware.<br /><br />The inline controls worked great on my Samsung Galaxy S6.  The up and down buttons shift the volume.  Hitting the center button pauses the music, and a quick double hit skips to the next track.  Hitting the center button once also switches over and answers an incoming call.<br /><br />As an unexpected bonus, the buds/mic worked flawlessly on my Windows Phone Lumia 830 as well.  I could adjust the volume, pause and skip, and answer calls.  I can’t test all Windows Phones, but I suspect any Windows 8.1 or later device that supports incoming mic sounds through the headphone jack will work with these buds.<br /><br />Honestly, I don’t really have any complaints about these buds.  With the convenient storage case, they are going to become my primary travel headphones.  It’s possible to complain a little about the price point, but given the sound quality and expected durability, they are very competitive with the other similar options out there.  Additionally, if you’re a Windows Phone user and want something that will work with your phone, there is a good chance these Bose earbuds will have you covered.  I’m happy to report that these things are a legit 5-star product.hey are at the top of the quality list.  These buds will work well for reproducing most types of music.

"They broke pretty quickly even though they were metal crafted. I would not pay this for a pair of earbuds again, mostly due to the ease of damage. I loved them while they worked though. Sennheiser makes some great headphones.",positive
"These work very well in the Nikon R1 flash system - specifically the SB-R200s.  I bought these very tentatively, unsure if they'd somehow kill the flashes given their potentially different voltages from the nominal 3.0V, but I've used them a whole bunch now without any issues at all.  Flash recharge times and in fact general cycle counts [per charge] seem very much the same as non-rechargeable CR-123As, which surprised me, but there it is.<br /><br />The included charging kit pretty much covers all bases, except a USB adapter I suppose.  Charging is pretty quick, too - at least compared to 18650s or NiMHs of any shape.",positive

It's smaller and lighter, easier to carry with it's built in handle and AM reception is better than my old Grundig.  I love this radio.",positive

"i was led to believe this was a linear amplifier, I was surprised to find it was a switching amp which would not drive my Polk Audio Speakers.

"This was to to replace a HDMI to S-Video converted which burned out after a couple years.<br /><br />After about 5 minutes the audio of what I was watching was replaced with a high pitched squealing.  I muted it because this is a second TV in the room and I could listen to the other.  After about an hour the video stopped working as well.<br /><br />The video signal is mediocre, but this is true of all 3 of these converters I have used.  The audio has quite a bit of hum to it, but this was also true of the previous one.  The performance while it was working was acceptable, but the blank screen with high pitched squealing wasn't.",positive

"This mount is okay, but I wouldn't recommend using it on anything bigger than 42&#34;. This mount is very short (horizontally), so when I mounted a 50&#34; to it, there is literally no room to move the TV from side to side. I replaced the bolts they provide and used security bolts which require a special adapter to remove the bolts. I really cranked down on the bolts because I was afraid that if someone accidentally bumped into the TV it could move it a fraction causing the TV bracket to come off the wall mount plate (there is NO ROOM TO SPARE, so ANY movement in a sideways direction and it will be off of the mounting plate).<br /><br />Here's the model that I've used on over a dozen TVs (all 50&#34;) and they were able to allow movement of the TV 4-5&#34; in either direction and not cause me to worry: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BT0RT8Q?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_26",positive

"This mount is strong and can hold a considerable weight when properly installed, hence follow directions and attach firmly to the wall. It doesn't have the greatest amount of angle variation so tilting it from vertical much more than 10 degrees isn't going to happen. I don't think they are manufacturing them anymore, I would think due to how sturdy it is and how much lighter flat screen televisions are becoming as technology advances.

I bought this because my old 5th Gen wore out (battery).  I wanted the bluetooth option so i physically work without the cord wiping around.  It does that well so it gets a star.  However: because it is so hard to operate I never use it to work with because I can't take the extra 3 minutes or so to get it to operate.  Hate it!  Wasted my money.

"My wife misplaces two things almost every day.  Her phone and her keys.  When this happens it becomes my responsibility to locate them for her.  This is not something that I particularly like to do since I have a specif location for them things and have set aside a space for her as well.  I bought this for a Christmas gift for her last year and my life got better on Christmas day when she unwrapped it!<br /><br />We placed a receiver on her keys, my keys, her phone and in a medical bag I carry everywhere.  We use the finder to locate one of these items almost every day.  Even buried in my bag which is buried in my backpack I can still (faintly hear the beeping).  I have not yet found a good use for the other 2 receivers but I am sure that I will.  I am considering dropping one in her purse without her knowing.<br /><br />Setup is a breeze.  Just pull the tab on the fob and it is ready to go.  Some are a little stiff and require opening up the battery door to loosen the grip on the plastic tab.

Also the tilt of the time goes up and then backward. So if it's on a night stand next to the bed it only can go further behind your head, not in front so you can view it. The only way to view it in front of you is if you put it on a stand at the foot of the bed, but then there's the whole no glasses thing. The buttons, you have to push them multiple times to get them to work, except for the snooze button on top which is very handy and accessible.

"I originally had iSport Victory (grey) headphones for 3 years (until I let someone use them and they broke them).  Those headphones (iSport Victory) were great.  They had amazing sound and isolation and were comfortable for long periods of time.  These headphones (which I received today) are a struggle to get into my small ears even with the xs adapters, and from my initial sound test sound somewhat tinny compared to the other headphones.  As of right now these are NO where near the sound quality, or as comfortable as iSport Victory.  I rated them as OKAY  (3 stars because) due to the reduction in price, and since they seem like they will be durable and have good bass.  If after a week of use my opinion changes, I will update my review.",positive
"The sound on these was okay, but the bass was a bit low.  I bought these strictly for running and found them to be a bit awkward.  They did not stay put as i would have hoped and the wrap around didn't work a well for me, I felt like I was constantly having to mess with it.  The connection to switch out cord lengths is very heavy and unless its fastened down keeps hitting you while running which was a bit annoying.  My bigger issue was that the sound would cut out while running.  I ended up sending these back and JLab customer service was great and made the process very easy.",positive

"Look what I wrote below in August of 2015, now read this update:  It's May of 2016 and this battery has failed after just 8 months.  The original battery Verizon suppled lasted nearly 7 years.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 1.  I realize a sample of one is in no way a guarantee of widespread results - I just wanted to share.   Original Aug 2015 review begins here:  I just ordered & received this a couple days ago, so this review only pertains to face value of the product.  We use Verizon Fios, and the original backup battery they supplied reached end of life after 7 years. Verizon wanted $45 for a replacement.  This battery essentially has the same specs at less than half the price. Upon receiving, I can see the size is exact. The build quality and weight are the same - so I'm giving two thumbs up as it seems like a nice deal. Now I just hope it lasts as long as the original. BTW, be sure to look carefully at the connector (&#34;terminal&#34;) sizes of the different batteries. If you search for Verizon Fios battery replacement, some of the batteries that come up use the smaller F1 size. Our optical terminal needs the slightly larger F2, which is what this one is.",positive

It's solid and non of it feels flimsy or made me feel like I shouldn't be mounting my brand new TV to it. In terms of actually mounting it? I had the TV on the wall in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />TLDR: Great product, great price, easy install. Buy it.",positive

"One of the cases was broken on arrival.  It appears that the shrink wrap packaging was the cause.  It is possible that it was due to crushing of the bubble envelope in transit, but this seems less likely given what the package looked like on arrival.  The case that arrived intact appears exactly as advertised, including the Panasonic logo.  Seems sturdy enough and the clasp mechanism keeps the case securely closed.  Given the breakage others considering ordering this product might consider ordering the six pack rather than the two pack just in case.  I'm not returning for a replacement because the return postage and the time spent just aren't worth it.  I gave it three stars because the definition for three stars is &#34;It's okay.&#34;  The two-star rating definition is &#34;I don't like it.&#34;  In fact I do like it, but only the one that wasn't broken.",negative

"The initial appearance of the product was great. The design is great, the earbuds easily fit into your ear and don't fall out even with movement. I was able to easily pair the earphones to my iPhone 5s and got it all worked out. The range of things the earphones can do (take calls, play/pause music, volume adjust, etc.) is great. The product comes with a wonderful carrying case and many choices for ear buds and ear inserts to replace lost or non-fitting ones. Everything was great and I loved this product. I played some music while sitting on my sofa and they worked great. I just took the earbuds for a run and was very disappointed. I'm not sure what is going on, but the music skips a lot. It's almost as if I was running with a CD player and every little knick or bump on the road caused the music to skip. It wasn't the bluetooth connection, it didn't seem like volume was lost and then would come back where the song should be. Instead, the music genuinely skipped, like I said above, like a CD player being tapped. I thought it would work out or that I could just ignore it since it was only one skip about every 100 feet. But twice during my run (at miles 2 and 4) the skipping got so bad I had to stop and turn the earbuds on and off. I wore them while in the car later that day and they worked great (no skipping), but as soon as I started walking at my destination the music began to skip again. I have used other bluetooth devices with my phone and know it is not the phone's bluetooth broadcasting or receiving. I'm talking with amazon to see if they can replace them and hopefully this is just a manufacturer's defect in just this pair.  Good: -great fit -work when sitting still -easy to pair with phone -nice design  Bad: -music &#34;skips&#34; when walking or jogging -earbud with controlls give off a rattling sound when running",negative

"I've been a loyal Sony fan since childhood.  This is the first time they've disappointed me.  I know little players like this won't have perfect sound, but I do expect talk radio will be clear enough that I can listen without having to strain to understand what's being said.  It's impossible on this unit.  I've tried AM and FM and CD music.  The sound quality is so poor, I couldn't tolerate more than 5 seconds of the CD I'd put in the player.<br /><br />The treble range on this player is just abysmal. To illustrate: there is no discernible change in the way this player sounds when I shut the door to the room it's in and listen to it through a wall.  The volume is lower, of course, but the sound clarity I perceive is precisely the same. Higher frequencies are readily blocked by obstacles so speakers with reasonable sound quality should exhibit a noticeable difference in the sound you perceive when you place a wall between yourself and them.  If there's no difference, you can conclude the treble frequencies are not being adequately reproduced.<br /><br />I wanted to like this little player.  It fits perfectly in a small space.  The controls are intuitive. It's a good price. But it's purpose in the universe is to reproduce sound adequately.  And at that, it fails.",negative

"Extremely happy with this purchase!  I bought this receiver to replace my Sony STR-DG910, which after a recent 4K TV purchase (Samsung UN55JU7100 - great TV btw) I decided needed replacing so as to have HDMI 2.0 support through my receiver.  I've been meaning for at least a year to get a newer receiver so as to have better network capabilities for streaming purposes, and so glad I waited until now to ensure the HDMI 2.0 support.<br /><br />Setup of this receiver couldn't have been easier.  I was surprised to find so little printed documentation included (a few disclaimer pages, a one page quick setup guide and a CD is included with electronic docs, but I downloaded the owners manual from the Yamaha site to ensure I had the latest copy).  The printed one page quick setup guide that was included was sufficient for the initial setup, for which I used the included YPAO microphone to ensure my 7.1 speaker system was synchronized properly.  One issue that I did have was that my XBOX One initially had no Video/Audio, but after replacing the stock HDMI cable that came with the XBOX One all was back to working.<br /><br />The options that I love in this receiver are: 1. Bluetooth support, 2. streaming support from a DLNA server, and 3. great free iPhone app.  I initially started streaming mp3s to the receiver from my iPhone (which worked great), but thought why not stream directly from my home server where all my music is stored.  I tried three different DLNA server software products: TVersity, Plex and Serviio.  TVersity was good, but was not free, Plex didn't seem to offer the ability to view my music in the folder structure I have it in, only by Artist, Album, etc, and Serviio was much like TVersity, only free (hence my choice to use Serviio).  Regarding the iPhone app, it gives a lot of the functionality of the remote control, though could use some updates just to make it more user friendly and perhaps a better aesthetic (but for free, I'm not complaining!).<br /><br />Two things I'd like to see improved:<br /><br />1. Please allow the removal of unused Inputs.  I hate scrolling through more Inputs than I'm actually using, so giving me the option to remove some unused Inputs when scrolling through the available Inputs would be well received by me.<br /><br />2. Ability to upload Wallpapers to the receiver - there are only two included, one a Piano and two is simply a Gray screen.  Not a biggie, but I imagine this shouldn't be too difficult.<br /><br />Overall this receiver was one of the best electronics purchases I've made in years.  I highly recommend it and hope this review helps :)",negative

I would've loved to get another pair of 58V's but they're discontinued and now everyone is charging double the price for them so I had to find an alternative.<br /><br />I probably shouldn't have trusted the reviews but I got suckered into buying these. They're not terrible and actually, the mic sounds better than any other headset I own. They also fit absolutely perfectly and seem like they'd never fall out either. The Sony 58 V's were the same way too which is a very important thing. It's extremely important to the sound of these headphones that they form a perfect seal in your ear canal. Many headphones you'll have to wiggle them around to hit the sweet spot but these fit perfect.<br /><br />The problem with these headphones is just the sound. Way too much boomy bass, not deep bass, boomy bass (probably around 120Hz) and worst all, almost no treble at all. They sound downright muddy compared to the sony's I have or even the $7 panasonic's I've got many times (the #1 best selling headphones on amazon). They just don't sound good to me. Not the worst but far from the best<br /><br />Pro's<br /><br />-the mic sounds great<br />-fit absolutely perfectly<br />-call button<br /><br />Con's<br /><br />-Sound really poor for music. Too much boomy bass, not nearly enough treble<br />-No mute button<br />-Not as good as many other headsets on the market<br /><br />I ended up selling these to my mom and order Sony MDREX38i's. I'm extremely happy with the Sony 38i's which do have a mic but to my surprise I think they actually sound better than even my Sony 58V's that I've loved so much",negative

"Update to my original review: it has been about a year and a half since I've owned this speaker and I rarely use it as the Bluetooth connection is extremely bad, any obstruction (stand in front of it, hold the phone with my hand) will kill the sound. Today, I took it out of my drawer to give it another shot and being 5 feet away from it, I lost sound connection.",negative
"Took a bunch of these to a destination wedding for my use and to let others borrow. They were cheap enough I could just leave them there since I don't travel to places the require these often. They fit the outlets great and worked for all of our US electronics (I can confirm phones, tablets, hairdryers, and hair straighteners were all plugged in).<br /><br />Probably not the most solid built adapters in the world, but for our week of use none malfunctions, broken, or did anything we would consider unsafe.",negative

Why am I giving this 3 stars?<br /><br />Pros: This has a very good battery life<br />  Its well made<br />  Digital display is very good<br /><br />So why the 3 stars?<br /><br />For such a large unit the plugs are too close together in the back.

"I've never been the type who particularly cares about synthetic chemicals. They make our lives better, they are reasonably priced, and they tend to be very effective.<br /><br />However, I was cleaning my kitchen a few months ago, and it occurred to me that I was essentially eating the antibacterial cleaner I was spraying on every exposed surface. Now that gave me pause.<br /><br />I set out to find good cleaning products that I could use in the kitchen, and ended up ordering quite a few of them. They tend to be hard to find locally, hiding out in overpriced &#34;organic&#34; grocery stores, and cost about three times what you would normally expect to pay.<br /><br />Some of them worked, and very well. I had particularly good luck with the liquid soaps and the general &#34;all-purpose&#34; spray cleaners. The ones the didn't work as well were the ones for glass. They don't use alchohol, so not only is that not there as a solvent, it also takes forever for the stuff to dry. It saturates the cloth and makes it ineffective for drying off the surfaces. And, when it does finally dry, it leaves streaks. I hate streaks.<br /><br />I tried this new one to see if it would work better than the others. It isn't actually new, just new over here, as it has apparently been around for a while in the UK, and the company has had such great success there, that they are trying their hand at international distribution.<br /><br />The microfiber cloth that comes with it is uncommonly thick. Not fluffy - dense. I wasn't sure if this would be good or bad, but in general I have experienced poor results from thin ones, which quickly become over-saturated with fluid, and fluffy ones, which lack the flat surface required to wipe without the dreaded streaking.<br /><br />First, I sprayed it on my very expensive laptop screen. A quick wipe with the heavy towel, and it was mostly clean. A few quick spritzes on the trouble spots, another wipe, and it was like new. For good measure, I also wiped down the keyboard using the residual left in the towel (don't spray your keyboard!), and it came out cleaner than I've seen it in years. Heck, the rubber trackpoint was actually grippy after the quick wipe-down. And, no streaks! This was very promising, so I decided to give it the ultimate test.<br /><br />I have a new AV rack with black chrome accents and large pieces of darkly-tinted glass. I had just finished assembling it, so of course there were fingerprints and handprints everywhere. There may have even been a face print or two. (I love the stand, but it wasn't the easiest thing to put together by myself!)<br /><br />Spritz, spritz, spritz, then wipe. The first thing I noticed is that this stuff dries insanely fast. Too fast for the way I was trying to use it, which was to cover an entire glass shelf with mist, then wipe the entire thing down with the cloth. Halfway through, the mist was dry, and I was only using the towel. Doing half at a time instead, however, worked wonders. That dark glass shows everything, and the fluid with the towel took it all off and made everything shiny and clean again. It wasn't just the towel, either, because when I tried the towel on the areas that had dried, it just pushed the smears around instead of lifting them.<br /><br />This comes in different sizes, so be sure to get the one that is right for your purposes. The 50 Ml bottle is large enough to hold enough product, but small enough for travel. It would tuck nicely into a dopp kit. If you just want to give it a shot before ordering a bigger one, that's the way to go. I'll probably take that one to work, and get the bigger size to use at home.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Sean P.

I was concerned before buying because all the dual-layer discs in a small batch I bought years ago (not the same brand, and when dual-layer was new) failed.  The majority of these Memorex discs have worked, but the failure rate is at least 1 in 4.  I tried a spindle of Verbatim later on, and have not had any trouble with those discs (even though I'm using the same drive and burn speed).  The Memorex DVD's are cheaper to buy, but not nearly as reliable, so you might end up paying more in the long run.",negative

"The most idiotic design imaginable - you have absolutely no say re. the volume the playback or alarm comes on at.<br />Apparently the designers decided you were to stupid to actually know what you want listen  they must decide for you. The unit resets itself to 20 volume every time, waking you up with the damn thing just blasting in your ear.<br />Same whenever you simply turn it back on.<br />And there is NO override for this &#34;feature&#34; (meaning defect).<br />Worse yet, trying to turn it down at that point simply turns it off completely. What moron came up with that idea?<br />In other words, it's actually useless as an alarm radio unless you actually like being jarred out of bed.",negative
"This is a great keyboard, if you have realistic expectations for it. A lot of the reviews on here are complainers saying &#34;I can't use it with my PS3, waahhh&#34; or &#34;You have to buy the hub for this to work, waaaah!&#34; If you don't want the hub, go get a regular bluetooth keyboard.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Works great with a home theater PC or Mac<br />- Works great with 3rd gen Apple TV<br />- Works great with Xbox One (needs one of the included USB receivers)<br />- Switches between devices quickly and easily (usually swapping a Bluetooth keyboard between two devices is a pain)<br />- Big enough to have easily usable keys and trackpad, small enough to fit in a side table drawer<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Only sort of works with Xbox 360, most applications don't support it (get a controller chat pad instead)<br />- Doesn't work with Samsung Smart TV (don't need to type on this much anyway)<br />- Initial setup is a little annoying<br />- Some input lag since keyboard communicates with hub, which then communicates with device<br />- I haven't seen this on sale ever, and no, 50 cents off doesn't count, Amazon<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you don't have a home theater PC you should skip this. But if you do, it's great. The keys are reliable and the touchpad is responsive. I was lucky enough to get one for far less than retail on eBay, but honestly I think it's worth full price if you plan on using it with a PC.",positive

"When I first got this, I really liked it. It was annoying to not have volume buttons on the speaker, but I dealt with it. It was also annoying that if I was playing music from my phone and received a call, the ring and voice would come through the speaker and I had to manually move it back to my phone. But I dealt with it because I enjoyed playing music through the speaker. However, I have only had it for 3 months and am already having troubles. My phone is having trouble connecting to it and then the speaker will drop the bluetooth connection - sometimes mid-song. When I play music, my phone will say it's playing on the speaker but the speaker isn't playing the music. I have to drop the connection and re-connect it to get music to play. I got so sick of the connection issues I bought the Anker Portable Speaker (A7909) and WOW - the Anker is totally better. The sound quality is so much better and battery life is twice as long. I didn't realize the DKnight sound quality was poor until I played it side-by-side with the Anker. Voices are crisper, bass is richer and I hear the various parts of the song better. It also has volume buttons on the speaker and if I get a call, the persons voice doesn't transfer to the speaker. I wish I had just paid more a few months ago and saved myself the hassle. I realize this has turned into a review of the Anker but I hate reading poor reviews of a product and wonder what product ended up working for that person... so if you can spare a few more dollars, buy the Anker ($27 vs $70). If you are strapped on cash, the DKnight will do and hopefully yours lasts longer than 3 months with no issues.",negative

"This is going to be a long story. On July 20 I received the Marantz sr5009 - a friend bought it and he decided to get a Denon instead. I was looking for one so I agreed to buy it from him. After bringing it home and going through the setup the video portion of the setup stopped working. Doing everything possible, to no avail, the video setup stopped working. Marantz said, sounds like the hdmi is out. So I brought it to a quote &#34;authorized repair center&#34;.  To my surprise the authorized repair center had no less than 20 sr5009 that needed repair. All of them with video, sound, needed to always reboot or restart the unit or freezing problems. My unit he said had a problem with the software &#34; it was, that is the file was corrupted and he  and it needed a new hdmi unit. So mine became the 21st unit on his shelf. So all these problems fall in the area of a bad firmware. ( for a laugh lookup Hitler's firmware update Disaster on YouTube).<br /><br />Ok Warranty the unit right - wrong calling my friend, send me the receipt. Sorry can't find it, Marantz won't warranty the unit without a receipt. There might be a hidden reason for that. I said, what about the serial number. Oh we don't use that! This is so beyond stupid it's not funny. Serial numbers for any product determine the model, year of production etc. Using the receipt is laughable - and should tell you about the company's record keeping. So while everyone is looking for the receipt I will pay for the repair.<br /><br />Some would say that the big lesson here is to not lose the receipt. No that's not it - in the automotive industry a car that has to be always returned for a repair is not a good car - we call it a Lemon! Because, there is a reason that the Authorized repair center had 20 on his shelves. All with software issues.<br /><br />The real lesson --- is DON'T BUY A MARANTZ. My friend that bought the Denon. OK you can laugh now his doesn't work either.",positive

"Here is an assessment that I could not find anywhere on the internet. I tested these Sony MDRZX770BNs against the Bose QC25s.  The test was to check the performance of the two items on a Bad Boy Outlaw with a 61&#34; cutting deck and 30HP engine. In other words, it is a very loud riding mower.  I spend about 2 hours on this mower. The simple test I used was to crank the mower up and turn it to full power with the blades engaged (this is as loud as the mower gets). I listen to NPR programming, (mostly Science Friday, This American Life, Fresh Air, and To The Best of Our Knowledge). Most listeners know that this is harder listening than music. Long story short, the Sony won. It really wasn't even close. I heard the programming with the Sony, I couldn't hear with the Bose. Now the Sony does have to charge up which can be an issue if you use them everyday and/or listen for more than 5 hours (I don't). After that, the noise reduction does really allow me to hear what is playing in the headphones. Only issues are deep voices with heavy accents. Medium and high voices are fine, no matter how thick the accent.  Keep in mind that I belong to the 35-44 age group and I grew up with loud music in the 80s and 90s, so age and former environment does matter with hearing.<br /><br />Of course I still hear my +/-110dB mower running in the background but it is like the mower is about 100FT away rather than right under me. Also keep in mind that these are my results for the mower application only. I have not flown with the headphones yet and I will never be able to compare them because I have already returned the QC25s. I can report on flight performance next time a fly if anyone wants to know. After testing them out locally, I purchased an Amazon Warehouse Deals pair for about $60 less because I feel like the headphones are still over-priced for what I use them for, but being ready to listen to NPR programs I missed for 2 to 4 hours (I wear them while using my weed-eater as well) isworth it. I also have read that we shouldn't be exposed to the noise of the mower for extended periods of time. I have not used the Bluetooth on it, and really don't plan to because there is no need to suck down the battery on my phone to do so. In any case they worked out.",negative
"As other have mentioned you can wear these for hours on end without fatigue, which is great.<br /><br />Works great with an Uber Schitt Stack.",positive
"The sound is surprisingly full and rich for a speaker this size.  I compared against two other small-format amplified speakers - the UE Mini Boom (retails for about $100) and a Sonos Play:1 (not really a fair comparison, since it is twice the price at $199 and not limited by Bluetooth and battery power).<br /><br />Here are my conclusions:<br /><br />For the price and size/weight it is the best sound quality I've seen in a portable bluetooth speaker.  Frankly, I expected the UE Mini Boom to stand up better by comparison, but once I tried them side-by-side (switching the exact source back and forth via the BT connection) the superiority of the JAM was obvious.  The JAM Heavy Metal had much brighter highs, fuller mid-range, and more natural/realistic bass.  Neither can produce &#34;punchy&#34; bass, but there was very little &#34;muddiness&#34; apparent in the JAM, which I could detect on kettle drum or string bass sections of big classical songs.  Listening to Steely Dan's &#34;Two Against Nature&#34; (one of my bench test recordings for audio equipment), the JAM was maybe even a bit too bright - the cymbal crashes were at times just a tiny bit harsh for my taste, but if you're someone that likes a very &#34;lively&#34; sound, this should be right up your alley.  Cranked up to full volume, both devices could hit about the same decibel level - &#34;room filling&#34; is probably a good description, but certainly not ear-crushing sonic walls of thundering music - these things are small.  Perfect for a picnic table or sitting outside with friends around the patio table.  Plenty loud enough for hanging out at the beach, but don't expect to be able to have an outdoor dance party with hundreds of people.<br /><br />How did it do against the Sonos?  Well, like I said its not really a fair comparison, but honestly it did pretty well.  The Sonos has MUCH fuller sound and is capable of about 50% more volume, but the dynamic range seemed very similar.  Considering its is half the price and as a battery-powered BT speaker is much more flexible and portable, the Jam again stood up to the comparison very favorably.<br /><br />Some other observations:<br /><br />Bluetooth pairing was very easy.  I never looked at the instructions and had the JAM paired to my iPhone 6 within about 20 seconds once it was out of the box.  Switching back and forth between the UE Mini Boom and the Jam I noticed that the Jam re-paired and began playing almost instantly, wheras the Mini Boom took about 2 to 3 seconds to reconnect and play.<br /><br />Integration to Spotify and Pandora (and the Music app on the iPhone) was consistent - the volume buttons, pause/play, and FFD and RWD buttons all worked from the Jam to send the appropriate command to the app on the phone.<br /><br />A few negatives:<br /><br />The controls on the top of the speaker are all exactly the same size and shape. In low light it is very difficult to tell which button is what without turning on a light (there are no ridges, dots, or tactile cues to help you find the power button or the volume buttons, for example).  It would be nice if they back-lit the buttons when you touch one, or at least put a dot on top of the play/pause button so that you could tell which one it is (and then can count one or two over to find the other buttons you want).<br /><br />The charging cord that comes with it is about 4&#34; long.  Seriously?  How is anyone going to find a table top that has an outlet within 3&#34; so that they can plug this in?  Plan on getting a longer micro-USB cord (luckily I have dozens laying around).<br /><br />The voice prompts for pairing, max volume, and &#34;powering on&#34; or &#34;powering off&#34; are in a very loud voice. If you have the volume on Max (which is typical for us) and then you turn off your music and forget about the Jam, it will automatically power off after 15 minutes (a nice feature).  The problem is that it will suddenly say &#34;POWERING DOWN!!!&#34; very loudly and scare the bajeezus out of you if you've dozed off or just forgotten about it.<br /><br />The packaging is another example of excessive use of plastic. It is packaged like an action figure in a stand-up hard crystal acrylic/plastic case, all of which goes into the landfill since its not recyclable in most towns.  I'd like to see more products like this packaged in simple recycled/recyclable cardboard boxes  without the glitzy shelf appeal. (at least for online sales)<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a very small and very portable player to connect to your phone or laptop via Bluetooth and have around $100 to spend, this unit appears to be a very good (if not the best) option out there.  In fact, I just gave my UE Mini-boom to my daughter to take to her college dorm room, secure in knowing that this unit produces better sound quality and is only slightly larger.other example of excessive use of plastic.

"Don't expect this system to compete with even an entry level soundbar. As someone who was coming over from a Sony Soundbar I have been disappointed with the sound from this pricey unit. The bass is very underwhelming, but I will say that general dialogue and music sounds pretty good. The room that this system is located in my home is fairly small but even then it sounds very weak. If you have the money to burn then be my guest, but if you are looking for a dynamic sound system........this isn't for you.",positive
"Decent remote, but sometimes buttons don't respond. Have to press harder. I love the light up feature.",positive
"Pros: Cheap.<br />It has a nice visual aesthetic to it.<br />The radio antenna is short but gets pretty good reception in my area.<br />The little speaker actually sounds nice.<br />The battery life is quite good once you turn the light off.<br /><br />Cons: Everything else.<br />The MP3 feature is almost unusable in my opinion, because you can't sort files according to folder or choose in which order to play songs.  The player automatically plays the MP3s in the order you copied them to the USB flash or SD card.  You can only skip ahead one song at a time.  You can't select an album or artist or anything like that.  If you put hundreds of songs on a card, you'd better be prepared to listen to them all for hour and hours in exact order or spend all your time pushing the fast forward button.<br />The screen only features four digits in a basic LCD display (like an alarm clock).  Songs are all shown as a number.  If you can figure out which song you want to listen to, write it down so you can skip to number 78 or whatever it is and hear it again.  This definitely isn't a replacement for a standalone MP3 player.<br />The player automatically searches out FM stations and enters them as presets.  As far as I can tell you can't manually tune to a frequency.  If the player skips over a station you want to hear, too bad.<br />The light-up LED is neat but more of a gimmick and you'll probably turn it off after a couple uses.<br />The interface is very basic and takes some getting used to.  You have to hold down the reverse and forward buttons to adjust the volume, for example.  If you want to turn on or off the LED you have to hold down the menu button for a few seconds.  There are only four buttons total to control everything on the device.<br />The text on the box is written in English but the manual inside is written solely in Chinese.  I had to play around with the unit through trial and error to get it to work at all.  The player may have more features that I'm not aware of. For example, I never figured out how to set the clock.

"Left bud stopped working within a couple of weeks. Then, somebody from Gear Beast contacted me and said I should return the product for a free replacement. Did that, got a new one, and the same thing happened- one of the earpieces stopped working within 2 weeks. Looks like this procuct is flawed.",negative
"Very difficult to install. The screws are insanely short, so it makes installing the spade connector very difficult to install under them. I kid you not: the difference between being able to slip the spade connector under the screw, and having the screw simply fall out, is less than half a turn. THE SCREWS ARE TOO SHORT!",positive

"My daughter picked this with her own money (which we all know is a big deal), put a ton of songs on it, a couple of movies (which somehow I can't get loaded into the correct folder in order for it to play on the device; huge bummer for her)... I knew as soon as she opened the package it was as cheap as the price we paid. However, I put a smile on and told my 6th grader, &#34;You need to keep this thing in a cloud made of butterfly kisses. I mean it, it WILL break if it is dropped.&#34; She slipped it real easy in her pocket and ensured me with her life nothing would ever happen to it. Uh huh. That was June 25. On July 10, she slipped it in her pocket, went to the park to swing and came back with its underlying layer of glass shattered.<br /><br />Really, the thing is cheap. It might as well be from Dollar Tree. The $20.00 is for the 16 GB. The space on piece of plastic is the only thing it has going for it. It is delicate. I don't recommend.",negative

"Given cost vs. capabilities, this represents a very real value. The weak point is that I have not discovered a workaround for macros to change sources selections. All units turn on with master power which is very convenient but a more advanced macro such as changing sources does not allow for toggle on and off functions which will cause a bit of stumbling for the end using when using one of the eight available macro storeage keys.

Yes, there is a very slight lag with streaming video on my laptop, which is mostly what I've used it for so far, but it is within an acceptable margin, and a small price to pay for big sound that I can ALWAYS hear, no matter what other noises are interfering.

"I am loving my Bluetooth Shower Speaker.  It functions as advertised and is waterproof.  However, it does use suction to adhere to the walls so it would be wise to remove and replace the speaker every three days or so to ensure the suction stays in place.  In addition and although the speakerphone function is a great addition, the quality of the sound is not that great.  I find myself having to yell to be heard while in the shower.  Other than that, packaging and shipping was quite sufficient and fast (2 day).  I must say that it is a useful speaker.  Thank you Amazon!",positive

"Looks and works fine - as expected. Easily programmed my TV and Blu Ray player, and assumed (wrongly) that the remote would work on the Xfinity cable box without programming. After searching for a few minutes online I found codes to program my cable box, but the remote wouldn't accept the code. A more thorough search revealed that the remote was locked. All told it took an extra 20 minutes or so to get it working right. Not a big deal, but a little annoying. Would have been nice to have this information in the user's guide. Here are the instructions I found that worked for my cable box (an old Scientific Atlanta HD DVR):<br /><br />The remote normally is delivered by Comcast with the Cable setup code locked. You can check that by watching the LED.<br />1) Tap the Cable device button.<br />2) Hold Setup until 2 blinks<br />3) Enter 01877 (SA 8300 uses this setup code)<br />The remote should blink twice. If it doesn't, and instead gives one long flash. then probably the setup code is locked. Unlock it by:<br />Tap the cable device button<br />1) Hold setup until 2 blinks<br />2) Enter 982<br />The remote should blink 4 times. If it blinks 2 times, do steps 1 and 2 again.",positive
The RCA plugs are wayyyy too tight. To get them on I was moving my Pioneer receiver. To get them off was worse. I almost broke the metal coupling.

"These are assembled by crimping the insulation in addition to the copper wire. Since the insulation is soft the copper cannot be crimped to the proper pressure for a solid electrical contact and thus will result in an unreliable connection that can easily separate and can overheat. You can easily pull the wires out.<br /><br />The wire strands are not all crimped so there may be only a few strands making connection.<br /><br />Since the insulation is thicker than the wire that the plug is designed to accommodate, the clamping screw does not tighten all the way down, bit protrudes above the surface of the insulator. The screw is in contact with the wire so whenever you touch the plug you touch the screw and are touching whatever voltage is on the wire! Even when assembled correctly, the insulation is still too thin to protect you.<br /><br />The wire size is marginal. Probably 24ga.<br /><br />If you do buy these, take them apart and assemble them correct. Then put some tape or heat shrink over the screw to protect yourself from shock.",negative
Great receiver. Delivered on time and in excellent condition. Had instructions to connect to devices but NO OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS.,positive
"Got 2 of these.  First one I used, the right side experienced sound loss.  It was as if the volume was only outputting at around 20% and all I could hear was the left side.<br /><br />Second pair I used had the reverse problem.  Left side only outputting about 20% volume while the right side was fine.  No idea what is causing this to happen, especially after about a week or two of use.  I would say try a different brand of sports headphones.  Do your research and don't spring for the first ones you get.

"Edit: I am indeed going to send it back. It is clear some of the buttons have far more wear and tear than others. I won't stand for this bulls***. I should have looked farther for speakers, but I saw 1000 4.5 star reviews and figured I would be safe.  Nope. The service was just an utter disappointment. Changing from 2 stars to 1. I can't believe they would just send me a used speaker and call it new. I really should have taken pictures of it before I cleaned a lot of it off myself. Well at least the next person they send it to will have a slightly less dirtier speaker than I got.    Had some disgusting looking smudges and a few circular looking ones presumably from something that the evident previous owner spilled on it. Quite disappointed when I took it out of the plastic sleeve. That being said, it works (as far as I can tell) fine. The sound is awesome; so awesome, that I might not send it back because I do not want to have to deal with all that.  Additionally, warm water + a few napkins took care of 85% of the smudges. I'm gonna do that a few more times, and use soap on the circular stains and I think I can get it looking new.  I'm kind of astounded at how disgusting it was; some people are just absolute slobs; reminds me of when you get a redbox DVD and its absolutely disgusting; like, how do people get things that dirty? Mini rant over.    Anyway, it works great (I think, I wouldn't know how a NEW one works, despite the fact that I ordered a NEW one).    Something that arrives with a label that says NEW accompanied by dirty smudges and stains from some sort of drink that spilled on it simply cannot receive 3 stars. That's my review.

"The bad: When downloading the software and using the MyHarmony Desktop app I kept getting the UE1000 error.  A little bit of searching found it was a very common issue at one point.  After 20 mins of frustration, I uninstalled and reinstalled and it seems to have fixed the problem. So you may need to be a bit tech savvy if you encounter this problem, but once you figure it out it's all good.<br /><br />The good: this has replaced 4 remotes! I like how it has &#34;activities&#34; for watching TV, radio, movies (bluray).  I'd always have to do the remote juggle: using the Xfiniti remote to turn on the box and the TV hoping that both turned on at the same time. Turn on the receiver and make sure it was at the right input.  Then control volume through the receiver remote and channel surf with the xfiniti remote.  If I wanted to watch bluray I'd need to change the input on the receiver, then use the Sony remote to navigate on the bluray and control volume via receiver remote.<br /><br />With Harmony 700 I'd just need to push one button to activate all the needed settings for TV or bluray.  I don't know why I waited so long to get one of these.<br /><br />I bought his as a refurb, but the remote looked in very good condition.  If there was issues I could always return so no biggie.  If you're on the fence get this already.  And if you get stuck find a young person to help trouble shoot ;)",negative

This speaker is ONLY worth the $40 it's being offered for right now.  It makes a good speaker to use near the shower to listen to tunes but it does not by any means put out a big sound. It becomes distorted if my phone and the speaker are turned up to max. It is durable and heavy.,positive

"Works as expected.  It's a little larger than I was originally thinking, but I have to admit I didn't pay too much attention to the dimensions.  It's ok though I just let it hang behind my TV stand and it's not visible.  It's something to consider though if you don't have a way to hide the antenna near your TV.",positive
These jumper leads have just a few ( two or three) very fine strands of wire as conductors which are not well attached to the clips.  The wires are so thin and few that I got a reading of two ohms from end to end on one of the larger jumpers!  I would be afraid to actually put them in a live circuit!  The (alligator) clips themselves are very stiff and hard to open for their size and near impossible to open due to the insulated covering slipping when trying to open a clip.  I can see that it would be very easy to slip and break wire-clip connection while trying to open/connect a jumper to a test point.  This is NOT a usable set of test jumpers for anyone who must depend on his/her test equipment & tools to be reliable in order to accomplish quality work.  These jumper leads are not good enough to even qualify as junk!,positive
Not very expensive but it works grear. Highly recommended.,negative
"I agree with another review; it doesn't eliminate all the noise. I love the sound but I originally bought them because my husband snores. It muffles the sound but if you have really good hearing you can still hear sounds they are greatly reduced and seem muffled. If you turn on your side while sleeping it is uncomfortable. The sound for listening to music, etc. is really good.",positive
"I can't remember if it was my dad who introduced me, but I have loved shortwave radios since I was a tween or early teen. As an adult, other pursuits pushed it aside, but recently I felt the urge to get a new unit and start listening again.<br /><br />Hopefully addicting my eight year-old to it too. :-)<br /><br />I did a lot of looking and research ahead of time (especially appreciating reviews at http://radiojayallen.com/), and settled on Tecsun's PL-880.  I could not have chosen a better unit.<br /><br />I'll let others comment on the technical side of things–I don't have the skills and knowledge to comment (yet). But I have owned a half dozen-plus shortwave radios in my life, and this is already my favorite. It is built sturdy, has amazing sound, and is relatively simple to use.<br /><br />I say, &#34;Relatively simple&#34; because a device with as many options as this cannot be entirely simple. If anything, that's one of the appeals of the unit:  if you want to just listen to stations, you can do that (and it is very simple). If you want to do all kinds of cool things (including leveraging its hidden features), you can do that (and some of is quite complex).  Luckily there are a lot of folks out there who who will help you dive into every aspect of this radio and shortwave listening (e.g. check out http://SWLing.com).<br /><br />I highly recommend the Tescun PL-880. It is worth every penny!",positive

"Overall the alarm clock works as described. The display is large and easy to see, but a bit too bright for us even when on the most dim setting. The projected time on the ceiling is very nice, and by itself is enough reason to purchase the clock. The alarm can be turned on to run M-F, S-S, or all seven days, but if your schedule differs from one of those three choices, you will need to manually activate/deactivate the alarm, which requires holding a button for a few seconds. Not bad, but a switch would be a bit easier.",negative

"Had these speakers for a few days now. Installation was not too difficult and generally happy with the purchase - does the job as required. However I have a couple of suggestions/questions that might help make this a higher rated item:<br /><br />1. The startup tone is way too loud  - since there is no direct volume control for this on the speaker, SA should really look into re calibrating the tone to be much softer as its very annoying each time the speakers are turned on<br />2. The bass seems to be nicely audible on the master (powered primary speaker). However, the bass on the slave (secondary non-powered speaker) seems much weaker and I'm not sure if this is because its not directly powered like the master? It could also have to do with the gauge of the included wire - I'm going to buy better wire and see if that helps<br />3. The whole point of these speakers is that they are &#34;wireless&#34; yet the biggest problem if you are mounting them, is that the power cord awkwardly hangs from the speakers due to a three foot difference in the power supply box to the plug. This makes it difficult to &#34;hide&#34; the cord - SA should consider shortening that distance and/or at the very least, provide some sort of mounting/attachment hardware so that the power supply can be easily hidden on the speaker itself.<br />4. Some reviewers have complained about the bluetooth range and potential &#34;signal cut outs&#34; on these speakers. I haven't really noticed that problem, but if people are streaming content, some the problem in &#34;reception&#34; might actually be due to being out of wifi range - I noticed my wifi signal falling in different spots as I walked around with my iphone in my backyard  - this, rather than the bluetooth range, seemed to be the reason my music was cutting out",positive
Great kits for the money but the holes didn't line up on my 32&#34; Emerson.

"Well, I had high hopes for this product after glowing reviews on Amazon and Head-fi.  I am clearly in the minority here but I was very disappointed with the sound.  First, I don't consider myself an audiophile but for comparison, I was using the following:  AKG Q701 Audio Technica ATHM50x Sony MDR V6 Sennheiser HD 598 Philips SHP9500  I also paired the headphones directly with Macbook Pro and with Creative E5 amp.  Build:  This thing is built like a tank.  It's extremely well built and absolutely sexy to hold on to.  Philips did an amazing job at the build quality and puts many other audiophile grade equipment manufacturers to shame.  However, this is where the high praise ends.  As this thing is so nicely built, it's also extremely heavy and the clamping force is enormous.  I have not been this uncomfortable wearing since Audio Technica ATHM50X which are known to have plenty of clamping force.  And thats the trade off. The build quality somehow negatively impacts listening comfort.  Sound:  Out of the box, these sound crisp and easy to drive without any amp.  I was using FLAC files on my FIIO X1 and at 50 volume level it was playing at a comfortable listening level.  I was blown away by the bass, however that euphoria lasted 5 minutes as I got so uncomfortable with the bass overpowering the mids, I thought there was something wrong with me.  I did A/B testing with other headphones and I found out something about myself. I DONT like overpowering Bass.  Along with high clamping force and unbearable bass, I had to remove it.  But then I discovered something.  The Philips SHP9500 (bought for 50) with 50mm drivers were quite similar but very much neutral.  I was surprised that a $50 product could compete with a $300 headphone so well.  With AKG Q701 already in my arsenal and Philips SHP9500 at a fraction of the cost, I decided to stop the torture and return this sexy beast. Save your money and get the SHP9500",positive
"This little speaker is an amazing little compact piece of technology. Its design is very basic as in it is a simply cube centric design, but is done in a way that makes it an impressive and beautiful speaker. The glossy fingerprint resistant shell feels and looks wonderful, especially when you get up close and are near the speaker. The top speaker portion of the device with its textured and dotted speaker adds a subtly but nice touch. The simple and minimalist I/O on the bottom and back are easy to use and a nice stylish attachmen",positive

"I love these things!! I use them when I run five miles every morning so the ear padding gets a little damp, but I've not had any problems yet and they stay on just fine. The battery seems to last forever and connecting with my iphone is a snap (just turn it on and press play)  UPDATE:  Now that I've used these for about 7-8 months, hopefully I can say a few helpful things, both pro and con:  One issue began after about 6 months: about 5-10 minutes into my run, I usually hear a little static then then silence for 5-10 seconds after which they work just fine for the rest of my session. Yesterday, however, they failed completely. I suspect something is wrong with the bluetooth connection because my iphone wouldn't connect even though the headphones were on, charged, and in range. I'm wearing them now and they are working, so obviously this is an intermittent problem that is worsening. I've emailed the company about a warranty replacement/repair and I will update this this review based on their response and customer service. I checked the moisture issue and it's just the ear padding that gets damp and only from my ears sweating (I wear a headband so the working parts of the headphones never get wet, and since I run on a treadmill, there's never any rain to worry about.) This is the main reason I'm tentatively reducing the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars, as I expect better than this.  If this issue is resolved, I will be a very happy customer again based on my experience to date. After 7 months of regular use, here is what I've found:  Sound quality: really good. not audiophile quality but really good in all ranges from highs to lows. I listen to all kinds of music and I'm quite happy with the sound. And they sure beat ear buds and a stupid wired connection. Battery life: I can usually get about 2 weeks on one charge, so about 10-15 hours (about 2 hours per use) -- which is in line with the advertised charge length. The headphones usually tell me &#34;device 1 connected,battery high&#34; -- however if it ever says &#34;battery medium&#34;, it really means &#34;low&#34;, because it'll be dead within 30 minutes. I have to remind myself to charge them on a regular basis. Charging cable: proprietary -- I hate proprietary cords, we end up with drawers and boxes of cords for all the devices we own. Can't we all just be (the same) micro usb? However, I can deal with this.... it's a minor thing. Comfort: never had a problem, I find them very comfortable. yeah, your ears get warm because of less air circulation, but so what? Ears are supposed to vent body heat.... And they aren't so bulky that they block out voices and sounds in my immediate environment (although sometimes I wish they would...) Blue Tooth distance: The only time I've gone out of range was to test the distance. I left my iphone in one corner of my 2000 sq ft home, and walked to the opposite end of my home -- easily 35 feet and 6 walls -- I was 4 feet short of the other corner before the signal started to drop and I finally got an &#34;out of range&#34; prompt. I know I've walked a good 40 feet away at the gym, but that was uninterrupted line of sight. I can't count the number of times I've walked away and forgotten my phone somewhere while using these until I remember 5 minutes later. Microphone -- I bought these to listen to music and don't get many calls between 5-7am. The first few times I got a call, they didn't seem to work (other than alerting me to a call). However, once i figured out I had to switch the call to my bluetooth device with one touch (doh), the mic and sound quality proved just fine. It would be nice if they switched automatically, and then let me switch back manually --- especially when I'm running, but that's a minor annoyance I can live with.",negative

Excellent buds at an even more excellent price.  I personally can't justify spending $$$ on buds as they're so easily lost/broken/stuck in the bottom of your purse.

"This remote is pretty good, but not spectacular.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br /><br />1. The code support for TVs, DVR/PVRs and streamers is good.<br /><br />2. The remote has a nice solid feel.<br /><br />3. It has lots of buttons for obscure features like PIP.<br /><br />4. Learning mode works better than any other universal remote I've had.<br /><br />However, there are some cons:<br /><br />1. Inteset has just a handful of codes for audio equipment; that's a far cry from being &#34;programmed with the device codes for every TV, computer and A/V device known.&#34; None of the codes worked with my receiver; I had to learn them all from the remote that came with it.<br /><br />2. The Tivo code assigns skip ahead and skip back to two buttons in the PIP section. This is doubly strange because the remote has labeled buttons for those features. You have to move the functions to the correct buttons yourself. The Inteset support forum has a post about how to do that; search for &#34;roamio&#34;.<br /><br />3. The remote has a glossy finish around the upper buttons that really shows fingerprints.<br /><br />4. Four devices is pretty limiting.<br /><br />With all that said -- it does in fact work with everything that I programmed it for, but it took a couple of trips to the support forums and some learn-mode programming to get it all to work.<br /><br />PRO TIP: Many TVs have codes to directly select a specific input like HDMI 1, HDMI 2, etc. This is great for programming a device macro. Problem is, the factory remotes usually can't send those codes. HOWEVER -- if you have an Android phone with an IR blaster, set up the Peel Smart Remote app to switch your TV directly to a specific inputs (using the Activity feature). Then use the learning mode on the remote to teach it the direct-input codes from Peel. Works like a charm.",negative
"This is a great iPod. I love the small size. The 16GB holds more music than I can listen to in months, which is nice. I let it load randomly from my iTunes library, which is quite extensive. I then go through and eliminate certain artists (ones that are not of my taste) and cuts (intros, interviews, super long songs). This way, I get a lot of random songs and artists that I rarely hear. After I eliminate the &#34;chaff&#34;, I go back and add songs/artists that I like that were not added randomly. Now, I have the best of both worlds.<br /><br />There are a lot of little nuances that I stumble upon that make this iPod even more fun. A lot is packed into this little bundle of fun.",positive

"Looked decent when i unpacked it. But the integrated level was way off!!!! Use your own level to install this and ignore the crappy one on the mount. Do yourself a favore and throw away the hardware that comes with it, its all chinese quality bolts and screws. I had 2 lag bolts break and the bolts and nuts are very poor quality, go get decent hardware to make installing easier. Once i had it mounted i couldn't adjust up and down, took 2 people and i thought it was going to break. I have a 60&#34; TV mounted on it, its brand new so its lightweight, but was impossible to adjust down, always wanted to move in the up position. Its mounted on the wall, i leave it in one position and cross my fingers we dont have a big earthquake. I drilled additional holes and used a couple more bolts to grab more studs. I should have kept looking for a better wall mount.",negative
Awesome product.  I have purchased the 2 highest rated portable Bluetooth speakers (DKnight & Oontz) and this speaker has superior sound in my opinion.  I would definitely recommend this speaker.,positive
"These are great for cables to keep them from dropping to the floor and getting damaged. My phone charger cable kept getting stepped on and cords are not cheap! The one I have at work is a light up cable so I want to be careful to not damage it. I have begun to also use these on the cords I charge my phones on at night. I have my work phone and my personal phone and the cables can be a mess.

"I found the quality of this stereo RCA cable to be very poor. This was surprising as I usually scoff at people who pay lots of money for &#34;high end&#34; audio and video cables and believed this price point ($6 for a 3ft cable) to be fair.<br /><br />The main problem was that the outer shield part of the RCA connector was very thin, and of poor general geometry (too wide? cupped? not enough tension?) causing a bad/loose connection. If you wiggled the cable a little you would hear scratching from the speakers as the connector physically pivoted on the terminal. I tried the cable on a couple other components with similar results.<br /><br />There were some other concerning quality control issues as well. The length of the shield extending from the plastic body of the connector was slightly different on different connectors (4 connectors on this stereo cable) and even the red/white stickers on the connectors were poorly applied with a couple hanging messily out of their grooves.<br /><br />My conclusion: One star, substantially worse than the cheap RCA cables included with low end audio equipment / TV's.",negative

"Everything feels very durable, comes with a plethora of screws and other items. The tv plate has a level built in and it comes with a level. On to installation. they say they support 8,12, or 16&#34; studs, they mean it. If you are literally half an inch more than 16 it's too small.After drilling my holes and getting this all installed i used the 2 included levels to check how level I was. (i used a laser level for my drilling so i assumed i'd be level anyway) i collapsed it all the way in and checked the built in level and i was level. I pulled it all the way out and verified that the tv mount plate AND the base both showed level, they did. I put my tv on the stand and i was no longer level. It was still pretty close but definitely not level. also noticed that due to the design, if you close the tv all the way in, the tv is not centered. I'm having to keep the arm extended out about 1 foot to get the TV centered (you might think just slide the tv left or right on the mount plate, well i tried this and it works obviously but then the non-level becomes even worse. You can noticeably see the tv leaning. You pretty much need the tv centered exactly on the plate to keep it level at all.",positive
The look and feel of the leather  are a definite plus. This works fine if you prefer to use or read your iPad in an upright position.

"It does what it said it would. I get regular and HD channels, not sure if the antenna has anything to do with getting HD channels - I have a smart TV. Overall I like what it provides.<br /><br />Issues: the product is so flimsy. It's light weight which is good, but the little stand thing broke while trying to adjust it. It didn't just break the thing just fell apart in my hand - plastic. It's currently being held together by electrical tape. I like the idea of the stand, but it has a suction cap on the bottom that does not work at all. It fell every time I tried to stick it up...anywhere. It is currently being held down by tape. I guess the suction is supposed to stick to windows and what not, but the cord is also short. I have my tv in front of a window and wanted to put it in the window. It barely reaches. My cord to my iron is longer than this cord<br /><br />Like I said all in all it does what it should, but I'm going to try something else more sturdy, with a longer cord, and a proper stand.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to anyone? Yes, but only if they don't need it to reach far, if they have an extra suction cup that fits and works, if they don't have to adjust it much, and if they like the color blue.<br /><br />-Mek",positive

"I have had my 590's for about 2 years.  I power them with a lexicon RV 8 ran through a Oppo105 Blu ray player for the benefit of analog to digital HDMI. Overall I think these speakers are well worth the money.  The highs are dynamic and crystal clear and really impressive for first time listeners of a quality system.  At times, especially on certain music they do give me ear fatigue if I listen for a long period of time. The bass is decent but if you really like to rock out like I do satellite subs really enhance the sound ( I have 4).

"The smart hub has certainly eliminated the use of several remotes for me.  It has taken the guess work out of which input and device needs to be changed for member of the household.  Using the app is super convenient when the remote goes MIA or hides from you.<br /><br />This is the only harmony product i would recommend.  I love the idea, but with their other remotes, if anything gets in the way of the signal, it is a bunch of button mashing to get things back where they should be.  And if someone doesn't use the remote once, it is all in disarray. The smart hub eliminates that because the IR blasters are right next to your equipment and you have a lot more programming and resolution options.<br /><br />The app can be spotty sometimes, but it has improved leaps and bounds over my period of ownership",positive
"** Update after a few months usage. Updates are added with one*  Pros:  • VERY easy setup. Paired instantly with my iPhone 5. • Can walk around my entire house and they keep a steady connection. • Sound is pretty good for wireless, slightly tinny sound and not a strong bass, but I'm thinking this could be adjusted in my phone's settings.  Cons:  • *The included ear-clips that hold them into your ear are VERY VERY VERY easy to loose. The loosely clip onto the head phones, and can easily fall off. Would be nice, actually almost necessary that they include several extras with each order. They can't be but a few pennies in plastic, and amazon does not sell them so you have to go through the pain of buying them thru the manufacturers website.  • Included charging cable is a non-standard mini-usb connecter. If you loose it your out of luck, but others have posted replacements are available. • Included charging cable is VERY short. *And very easy to loose.  • Sound is a bit tinny, but probably on par for wireless headphones in this price range. • Could be a bit louder and could have more bass sounds, but this could be settings in my phone. • Charging socket when not in use is open, so it's possible this could get debris in it.  For use with exercising: • I bought these mainly for biking and hiking. They work well for this purpose, the connection for me seems to hold for the most part. That being said, while they work fine for a bike ride, on hikes they do cut in and out sometimes which is pretty annoying.  • When the plastic ear clips get sweaty, they do not hold well at all on my ears and will fall off. Not a big deal while hiking, but during a bike ride its a bit startling, your immediate response is   Conclusion: I've only used these for a short time, but so far I would recommend these to a friend to purchase. *With some caveats.",positive

"BUYER BEWARE! When an item is uncommonly low priced, something is fishy. As other reviewers have noted, this wire is NOT pure copper, but rather CCA (copper-clad aluminum).<br /><br />This is no small matter. Dissimilar metals cause electrolysis, which leads to oxidation. The oxidation causes corrosion and the corrosion causes an increase in resistance. Resistance at an electrical connection causes heat... and the cycle escalates over time with the possible eventual failure of the electrical connection. This process of degradation accelerates as voltage and current increases.<br /><br />During the 1970s & 1980s, as a cost-cutting measure, building codes in certain states were relaxed to allow aluminum AC wiring to be used in residential dwellings. A band-aid remedy for the oxidation problem was to apply an anti-oxidant goo at each and every electrical connection throughout the house -- with less than satisfactory results (failures, fires, and eventual revisions of the electrical codes to prohibit the use of aluminum AC wiring).<br /><br />Admittedly, speaker wire carries relatively low voltage & low current and an electrical fire is quite unlikely. But, CCA remains a less than ideal material for the long term and in certain regions, may not pass a home inspection at point of sale. For more info see: http://www.speaker-wire.com/oxygen-free-copper-vs-copper-clad-aluminum-speaker-wirecable-buyer-beware/<br /><br />The seller's description of the benefits of using quality wiring (without actually stating what THEIR product is made of) is a deceptive attempt to mislead the buyer as to the actual wiring material being sold. Either the product description should be truthfully revised or this wire product should be removed from the website... or the seller should be blocked from Amazon. Shame on these folks for such blatant dishonesty!",negative

When I first opened the package I was a little intimated but it was so very easy to assemble and place on my wall.  Not to mention, it fit my 55 inch tv perfectly.  The equipment is so sturdy and strong. I'm so happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone.",positive
"Good sound with some tinkering, but shows distortion in some compressed files (MP3 and Apple compressed formats).  The same files sound SO MUCH BETTER playing on the Bose Wave Radio III (or the version with the CD player built in), so I exchanged this product for the Wave Radio III and added the $99 Bluetooth adapter.<br /><br />Same streaming from my MacBook Pro and no distortion anymore.<br /><br />By the way, the Boom 2 adapter makes a great controller for these Bose music players with Bluetooth.  I have it on my iPhone and use it to control these.  The sound is also MUCH better with Boom 2, though it too can show distortion on some songs on the Soundlink Bluetooth Speaker III (not so much of an issue on the Wave Radio III).",positive
"Poor choice. Seemed good on paper and based on many positive reviews. However, first unit would not power up or charge. Was exchanged promptly by the seller which I appreciate. However, even though the second unit did work, it did so very poorly (very poor sound quality and would cut in and out during playback, then the first time it got wet it stopped working altogether). The seller did honor the money back guarantee so I have no qualms with the seller but the product was simply not usable - 0 for 2 could be coincidence but I was not about to risk a third time. Instead I purchased a &#34;Photive HYDRA Rugged Water Resistant Wireless Bluetooth Speaker&#34; for only a little bit more money and the difference in quality (sound and build quality) was night and day. Should have gone with the Photive to begin with. It sounds great for the price and works just fine after being drenched multiple times.",negative

Bought one from the Mitsubishi site for an unGodly amount of money (over $100) and only thought of looking on Amazon after. Works fine. Hope it lasts as long as the original - approx 2 years.

"The channel's tape is incredible, and it is a decent length in order to hide a few cables. However, the channel is waaaaaay too small unless you plan on running less than three cords of decent thickness. I have two monitors and a 5.1 channel speaker system, plus a few other cords I had to run and barely half of them fit in the slot. I ended up just drilling holes and used zip ties on the outside of the channel to hold the thicker monitor power cables and HDMI and DVI cables. Overall it works great but it definitely has its shortfalls.",positive

"The sound of this headphones is great, I was not expecting so great bass or such a high volume. A little adjusting on my Smartphones equalizer was required to adjust mids and highs, but out of the box the sound was very well performed.<br /><br />The quality in the meterial makes it soft to wear, it is more for larger heads, mine maybe a bit tiny since I feel it does not adjust properly without extending the headband, but is not an issue since the cups stick to my ears, covering them completely without smashing my head. It feels durable, which I hope so, or you will see me lowering the five stars as I did with the bluedio R+ which turn apart after a crack was made somehow in its cheap plastic headband.<br /><br />So far I am happy, I did not spend much money and I look classy with them.<br /><br />Any one considering them, I recommend these excelent pair.",positive

"This is a great adapter for the price, it works! With that said, I used this at an amateur radio meeting for a presentation, and a bunch of fellow operators brought to my attention that there was a bunch of interference in the room. We searched and searched for about 10 minutes and all signs pointed to this adapter, because when I unplugged all the broadband noise on UHF (440 MHz) ceased. Opening the adapter up, we found that there was not complete shielding through the entire adapter. Since a lot of us are electrical engineers, specialized in RF & communications, we came to the conclusion that because there are fast digital signals going through the adapter, whatever cable in the adapter turned into an antenna and started transmitting broadband noise in the UHF range. I really think that BlueRigger should investigate this issue and use proper shielding on this adapter, because the FCC and amateur radio operators would not be happy with this at all.",negative

"Bought this back in September 2014 for my iPhone, the packaging is very appealing, extra's are welcome (large choice of ear tips, carrying case). At first I was impressed, the sound is flat but very clear, just like other reviews said it would be (might sound strange at first, but after a while you'll get use to it), the cord is tick and sturdy, everything seems to be of top quality.<br /><br />I've had some problems with it (no product is perfect), it might have been back luck but, since I ain't a US resident, and paid quite some import tax to receive this, it wasn't affordable to send it back for replacement and/or repair, so I had to take it upon myself to fix it.<br /><br />After a few weeks, the remote started acting strange (buttons didn't work, moving the cord would make it skip all songs, like it middle button where being pressed repeatedly), one day I decided to open it up and have a look (there are no screws or glue, so you can easily open it up and close it again), i found out that the wires that went into the remote were making contact (short circuit) with the ones that went through to the earphone, so i reorganized the wires inside the remote and close it again, problem solved.<br /><br />After 6 months, the right ear-plug started failing, so there I went, taking it all apart to find the problem, the wire leading to the earphone was short circuiting somewhere near the &#34;Y&#34; where the they split, so I found a way to open it up (it's some rubber covering a plastic case, which holds together a small pcb where everything is soldered into, 6 wires come from the mini-jack plug, which are soldered on one corner of the pcb, and the wires leading to the earphones are soldered on the other corner of the pcb, no wonder that &#34;Y&#34; is so large). So i cut a small part of the problematic wire and soldered it back to the pcb, covered it with a thin layer of tape, bent a paperclip to strengthen the wire (in case i accidentally pull it) and covered that withanother nice layer of tape (it looks neater than that gigantic &#34;Y&#34; now). While searching for the problem, i opened up the earplug to see if something was wrong in there, the &#34;black spheres&#34; are nothing but a glued cap covering small screws that keep together a &#34;housing&#34; for the small (closed up) earphone, so the manufacturer's preview stating that these &#34;black spheres&#34; are acoustic chambers for better sound is just plain wrong.<br /><br />After these 2 fixes, the phones are performing great. I have to say it was pretty hard to repair them, and at this price range, I expected them to be more durable (it might have been bad luck tough).<br /><br />In short, these are nice enough earphones, but the price range should make you think twice.",positive

"From 38 to 77 channels ...  When my brother first recommended the Mohu to me, I was extremely skeptical.  I have tried many other powered and non-powered antennas.  I was in shocked - aghast disbelief - when the scan completed!  Channels I had never heard of 40-60 miles away.  And I sit just one mile away from Sutro Tower on Twin Peaks in San Francisco.  I can't wait until I take some serious time to re-scan and adjust the Mohu's height and location in my home.  I replaced a $19 RCA antenna from Target that I have used for years.  I am eager to see how the Mohu tolerates changes in wind, direction, and the fog all of which contributed to pixelated and non-existent/lost signals day-in, day-out.   T H A N K  Y O U!  6 STARS!  I plan to buy another.  Cutting the 'cable' never felt so incredibly good.",positive
"The range on these headphones is excellent. I could hear music clearly and easily through walls and all around my house from the transmitter being in another room with the door closed. Sennheiser is a good company as well, but the only thing I didn't like about them that was really bad is that when the headphones are on idle for about a minute or two, they will cut off into a horrible loud static until sound is transmitted. Since I am a songwriter, taking a moment to write down the lyrics is a crucial part of my job when I find something I would like to sing about. I found another pair that doesn't cut off after being on idle, so I ended up going with those. I would give these a 1 star or no star, but I don't agree with the use of hate in any concept of a rating. Sounds bitchy. Lol Anyways, I hope my review helped.",negative

I had an indoor antenna that I did get to work by placing it near an upstairs window and back feeding it through the coax wall jacks to the TV downstairs. This outdoor antenna does about 25% better than that. It was an easy install thanks to direct tv. I used their old mast and coax cable. That is the only good thing I got out of direct tv other than the satisfaction of telling them GOODBYE FOREVER!  I live in a small mountain town (Salida) about 140 miles away from the Denver stations so no chance of picking them up. There is a translator for the PBS stations here and those come in real good. I recommend this antenna.,positive

"[[VIDEOID:a80df4bf596234a0392be1ac1d4742a4]]...with a big footprint and lots of plastic.<br /><br />As microphone, the iGearPro SF-922B works just fine. I tested this in laptop and desktop computers running multiple versions of Window (7, 8.1 and 10). Each recognized it immediately when connected.<br /><br />Using \\""Audacity\\"" freeware for my audio capture, the quality of captured voice was very good in both .mp3 and .wav formats.<br /><br />Even with existing microphone capability (integrated into a laptop or a webcam), sometimes microphone that be reposition independently adds flexibility to audio recording tasks.<br /><br />The tripod stand for this microphone includes an adjustable friction clap that provides many options for how the mic can be positioned relative to the sound source.<br /><br />Why four stars instead of five? Two reasons. The first is aesthetic, and that is the outer construction which is dominated by shiny plastic. In my opinion, not a good look. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with small electronics made of plastic. Pretending they are made of metal cheapens the overall appearance. Second: the mic and its stand collectively create a rather large footprint. Users who are space-constrained may find they are looking for a more compact solution. Neither of these detract from its overall performance.<br /><br />Note: this item provided for review purposes.",positive

"This bar was a replacement for an Energy Powerbar Elite I had that crapped out on me. I like the features of this bar but the sound doesn't compare. This bar emphasizes too much on the sound effects, which in turn drowns out the voices. I'm currently on the fence about returning this bar. My previous soundbar gave me great balanced sound which I've become accustomed to. Even my wife agrees this is the worst sounding soundbar I've had. I previously purchased and returned Energy's CS-30 soundbar because it kept having a terrible buzzing sound( went thru 2 of those).",negative

"This is a basic surge protector with six three-prong outlets.  Because all but one outlet are so close together, this surge protector might not fit six power cords if any have the cable coming out of the side (as opposed to the back, which would make the cable point straight up when plugged in) or are oversized or are oriented in another direction.  In these cases, adjacent outlet(s) will be blocked.  There is one outlet about 1.25&#34; away from the others for larger power packs, but that's it.<br /><br />As a power strip with surge protection, this works well.  As a way to manage many different kinds of devices with their special plugs and power packs, it leaves something to be desired.",negative
"While most of you are probably familiar with Westone legendary W- and UM- series of Balanced Armature multi-driver IEMs (ranging from single to six driver designs), they also offer ADV series – an Adventure Series for active lifestyle.  This series has two models, Alpha and Beta, both sharing the same 6.5mm dynamic micro driver, removable reflective heavy duty cable + remote, and ipx-3 weather resistant rating.  They also share the same accessory package, including premium Westone eartips and a heavy duty case.  From the looks, the difference is mostly in the shape of the shell and the fitment: over ear, more traditional with Alpha and wire up/down barrel style with Beta.  Furthermore, their unibody design uses a different shell material: magnesium w/Alpha and zinc w/Beta.  It’s hard to tell about sound difference but considering the same dynamic micro driver and metal body with a narrow nozzle I have a feeling sound is going to be similar as well.  Thus, if you are looking into Westone Adventure Series, currently you have a choice of $49 Beta or $149 Alpha.  You do the math and determine which fitment suits your taste better, and I will move on with my review of ADV Beta!<br /><br />Westone packaging never disappoints because no matter if it’s their budget or mid-tier or flagship model – they go all the way with a packaging box featuring detailed graphics, complete list of features, and description of accessories.  Though I can’t comment on unboxing experience, I can tell you that accessories are definitely worth Adventure quality.  You get their 5 color coded pairs of silicone STAR eartips with each color corresponding to a different fitment size, and also 5 color coded pairs of foam TRU-Fit eartips in 5 different sizes.  These are the same premium eartips you will find with W- and UM- series of Westone IEMs, and you also get a cleaning tool since the eartips and the nozzle are very narrow (to scoop out the ear wax).  Plus, you get a cable clip, though Ipersonally never use it.<br /><br />Where you see a true adventure spirit is in a round hard shell case shaped like a hockey puck.  The top of the case unscrews and you have a durable plastic strap holding it attached to the bottom part of the case so you don’t lose it on the go.  The case is crush and weather resistant, with a soft touch plastic finish, and roomy enough for Beta with cable and extra eartips.  To be honest, I like this case better than Westone orange “vault” because with that one I always worry about snapping a cable when I close it shut (due to its smaller size).  Overall, ADV case looks to be durable enough to protect your headphones in rough environment.<br /><br />While Alpha has a more familiar bean-shape design you'll find with W/UM-series, Beta has a small short barrel shell and narrow angled nozzle.  The shell is very durable, has unibody design, and made out of zinc alloy.  Half of the shell toward the back is coated in soft rubber material which enhances the grip when you handle them.  The front of the shell has a large and clear stamped L/R marking to distinguish left/right sides.  You also get a removable cable with a short profile mmcx connector, meaning you can use any universal mmcx connector cable with these, but you can't use the included Westone cable with other mmcx connector IEMs since Westone uses a shorter one.<br /><br />The cable is very durable, and I like how the connector is also coated in a soft rubbery material with a nice strain relief to enhance the grip and single/double dots to distinguish R/L sides.  The fitment of Beta is wire down and wire over the ear, but instead of using a memory wire, they used a soft rubber tubing piece for a more comfortable fitment.  Either with a wire up or down, I found fitment to be great, and depending on eartip selection - outside sound isolation was also decent.  The rest of the cable has a fine braided cloth sheathing jacket with a reflective material to add &#34;visibility&#34; when you are using these in the dark.  In-line remote w/mic is located on the right side, and it features a durable sealed oversized design with multifunction button and iOS volume control.  Multifunction button works with most iOS and Android phones, controlling Play/Pause/Call with a single click, and Track Skip with double/triple clicks.  Cable y-splitter has a slim mold, rubbery, and very durable, and the headphone connector is slim, right angled, and with a good strain relief.<br /><br />So how do they sound?  ADV Beta has a very pronounced L-shaped sound signature with a strong emphasis on bass, recessed mids, and rolled off treble.  These are definitely not for critical listening, but rather for an active &#34;adventure&#34; lifestyle where durable build and comfortable fitment has a higher priority, or during exercising where you want to keep your pace up with a strong beat.  In terms of staging, their soundstage is slightly below the average in width and a little above the average in depth.  There is not much layering or separation since the emphasis is more on a low end.<br />In more details, low end extends down to a deep sub-bass and has a rather strong mid-bass hump.  Bass is a bit loose and spills into lower mids, overpowering the rest of the spectrum, making sound a bit veiled.  Lower mids are thick, and upper mids are recessed but still clean, though not too clear.  Treble is clean, smooth, and definitely rolled off.  Overall sound is smooth and non-fatigue.<br /><br />Since basshead sound signature is no longer my cup of tea , I wanted to see how ADV Beta will scale up with EQ adjustment.  Actually using it with Galaxy Note 4, I switched to Pop setting (less bass, more upper mids and treble - EQ preset) and found a sound to balance itself out from L-shaped to a more V-shaped, including a more controlled low end.  Basically, ADV Beta sound signature is not a limitation of the driver, but rather a choice of a default tuning.  Bottom line, don't getdiscouraged if you find bass overpowering the rest of the spectrum, and definitely give EQ or built-in presets a try.  Actually, this felt a bit like a deja vu from my W50 testing.<br /><br />Also, switching to Epic cable tightens up the low end and adds a touch of clarity to upper mids.  The sound still has a rather strong overpowering mid-bass hump, but overall it felt tighter.  Using pure silver cable results in more improvement, but I wouldn't recommend buying $300+ pure silver cable to fix a sound of $49 headphones.  But if you have one in your collection, give it a try.  Even a budget silver-plated cable will contribute to a marginal sound improvement.",positive

"I recently received my Orvibo WiFi Smart Socket S20 and was excited to put to use in my office setting, but was disappointed with some features. It is easy to connect to my wireless router from the iPhone app (v 3.1.9). Manual on/off control works as advertised from anywhere (I used if from inside the office and a couple miles away).<br />However, there are 2 serious problems I have encountered (so far):<br />1) Timers don't work: With my iPhone (IOS v8.4.1 - latest), I setup a Timer on the app so my desk lamp would come on at 8AM and shut off at 5PM every weekday. Programming this repeating timer was easy, but it didn't work for me. I arrived at my office after 8AM this morning to a dark lamp. I double-checked my time zone setting to make sure, and it was set correctly to my time zone.<br />2) Current device status doesn't work: On the app interface, the current status (on/off) of the S20 is supposed to be displayed. However, it appears as if the status indicator is actually showing the &#34;commanded&#34; status - in other words, what the app is telling the outlet to do - not what the outlet is actually doing. This is counter to the information provided by the manufacturer. This is an issue, because if you are remote and want to see if you accidentally left your space heater on back home, this won't help. In fact, it might get you into trouble if the heater was off and you inadvertently turn it on (thinking you were turning if off). This could cause a fire or other catastrophe, worst case.<br />Assuming the device status is communicated (2-way, as the box indicates) to the app, both of these defects could be corrected in software.<br />I implore Orvibo to fix these issues immediately, or lose market share to its competitors.",negative

"Not what I expected for the price. Using with tube headphone amp. Bass is really lacking. Maybe with an equalizer, you could improve the response.<br />Overall comfort is good. Construction appears solid so far.<br />Would not recommend when using tube amp.",positive
Male end separated and stopped working after 2 weeks of moderate use.,negative
Bought these for my son for his birthday and he loves them.,positive
"The item arrived swiftly in good quality. There was no packaging aside from the padded envelope it arrived in. I purchased this as a replacement to the oem power supply for my QNIX QX2710 monitor which seemed to have gone bad. This unit does not get nearly as hot, comes with a grounded US cable, and seems to be in good working order. Will update if any problems arise.",positive
The cable is probably ok but it won't work with my iPhone 6 because I cannot plug it in without removing my Incipio case.,negative
"following the guidelines-<br />Explain why I liked or disliked it- Won't know because when it finally get's here I'll stick a stamp on the package and return it, as I will have purchased a replacement this weekend.<br /><br />Compared to a similar product - My last item worked great until I lost it. Of course it started working immediately instead of 5 weeks from now.<br /><br />Specific attributes - They appear to be light so it won't cost me more than a few stamps to return it ( when it finally gets here )",positive
"This is a really sturdy, heavy weight speaker.  I was surprised by how heavy it is so to say it's portable I'm not so sure about that.  It can only be connected to one paired bluetooth device at a time so no surround sound with this speaker. But it does have good sound on its own, not the best for the price. Bass tones are not the best. It was a little difficult to set up initially, you have to download software updates which took a while. You also are supposed to get the app Sony Pal. I'm guessing it's been sitting in a box somewhere for a while. It does have an audio in port so you could connect an external device.  For the price I think you could find a better quality sounding speaker. I prefer Bose mini speaker over this one.",positive
I bought this lamp and waited a few days for delivery. It worked one night and I can't get it to come on again. I've ordered a new lamp. OT from this manufacturer.,positive
"Cords work, but if flexed in the wrong direction, you loose connection between the tv and device.",positive
"Very elegant case. It actually has capacity for 108 discs which I was very impressed by. Great size too, not clunky and not too small. The material is of very high quality and the disc cases are made in such a way that the discs do not get scratched and for $14.99, it´s a great deal. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who travels.",positive
"The good:  Extremely comfortable, lightweight and produce good sound.  Easy to pair and operate.  Extra stabilizers and 2 pair each of small/medium/large ear buds. Comes with a case that holds everything which is a huge plus for me.<br /><br />The bad:  Audio cuts out frequently - as in a few times per minute.  Tested with multiple different devices (individually) with the same results even over short distances of 2-3 feet.  Unfortunately this is a deal breaker for me and I will need to return them.<br /><br />The audio cut outs are definitely a disappointment since I really like all other aspects of these headphones.",negative
very large... you can also organize lots of things inside.,negative
"These headphones are awesome! Sound quality is great, bass level are deep and rich, and the build quality is also not cheap. They are made very well and fit much better than any of the Bluedio headphones, and they sound much better too. I bought a second pair for my wife,and we both wear them to workout. I would definitely recommend these as a great pair of headphones without breaking the bank.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Sound quality is awesome.<br />-Battery life is great. (I charge them once per week and use them to workout nearly every day)<br />-Build quality is good. They do not feel cheap and the controls and buttons are satisfying and easy to use.<br /><br />No cons found yet!",positive
The sound is good but both have developed cracks in the wood over the past few weeks.  It hasn't effected the overall sound but I worry about how long they will last since the inside of the earbuds is now exposed.  Update - The left earbud has stopped working.  It's been just about 5 months of use and the left one comes in and out randomly.  Will be replacing them with something more reliable very soon.,positive
I used this when my Mom was losing her eyesight and couldn't see the time.  She loved it.  Then I brought it into the classroom.,positive
"Unfortunately this cable did not work correctly -- the TV picture had numerous areas of noise and snow, and the sound constantly dropped in and out.",negative
Absolutely no difference in reception than my $9.99 Panasonic rabbit ears. I live right in the city on the side of the hill with an unobstructed view.,positive
"I tried this running on a treadmill.  No way!  The neckband slide down to my back within the first minute.  I do like the neckband design for wireless headphones, and I use one when I'm just at my desk or walking around, but this doesn't work when working out.",positive
well it might be a fine radio but it well not play in a mobile home i think there is to much metal on the siding.,negative
"We changed over to Eneloop batteries about 4 years ago,  We are still using the original batteries with excellent success.<br />Recommended for all applications.",positive
Works great. Not the best looking cable but it's durable and functional for what I need.,positive
Had these for a year or so. Intended to use it for filming purpose but ended up using it for personal use. They are good. Sound nice. But after a while of wearing them they hurt your hears. Not particularly high quality. Plastic but sturdy. You can bend the crap out of them.,positive
Bluetooth sucked. The audio was too scratchy and after a while it stopped turning on.,negative
Don't waste your money. This is cheaply made and I had to send mine back because it did not work right. I paid more for a Sony Mp3 player and am very happy.,positive
"It works.  But, make sure you have it placed exactly where you want it before you stick it to the surface.  Also, the tiny cords aren't held very tightly so they fall easily.",positive
Purchased product in July 2015 and mounted 48 inch TV 8/25/15 and very satisfied.,negative
Doesn't support multiple fan speeds. Wish it did. Lets hope for a GRID++ ;),negative
"I like them because they stay in. Unfortunately they don't work with my Samsung tablet so had to go back to the flimsy, easily broken Samsung earbuds. Sigh",negative
I like this case quite a bit. It makes organizing DVDs easy and is also great for traveling. We put the favorites DVDs in the pockets right inside the cover and the other DVDs go throughout the book.,positive
"Bought these twice, the first pair lasted about 8 months and I'm on my second pair now. The wire quality seems good, but the black rubber connectors are bad quality and break and expose the wires. If you get this, I would recommend getting more than one as it will probably break fairly quickly depending on use. I put them in my backpack pretty much everyday so the wires get bent in odd ways so this has definitely increased the rate of wear. Overall decent for the price",positive
"Wow just wow. The bulbs dim before they fail and mine sure did. Then it failed with a pop. I'm seeing colors and details I don't remember seeing when it was new, even on the low setting. My first bulb lasted 9 years on low. The new Toshiba bulbs have lousy ratings at 3 times the price. Yes, it is all plastic and feels cheap. Yes it has a slight smell like a portable heater. Too bad this bulb doesn't come up when you search 62HM15A only D95-LMP so not everyone sees this one. Super easy to change. If it holds up, I will be thrilled. A $35 part saved my $2500 tv! Update: blew up 12/16 had to vacuum the glass out lasted 15 months",negative
"Even in the best place possible to put it, I get clear picture, but it cuts out too frequently. Especially during any cloud cover",positive
One didn't work that long and the other didn't work at all,positive
The sound is thin overall and a steady background hum is present when used wirelessly.,negative
The packaging for this product required 10 minutes to undo with a pair of sturdy scissors. You have to be careful or you might damage the product. If another item comes like this I'll return. The only reason for this is ease in production with no concern for consumers or the environment. There is no way to recycle this plastic.,negative
"Seems to be fairly rugged, however sound quality is not what I was expecting from a speaker at this price point.",negative
Much bigger than I anticipated.  Returned due to size.,positive
"This works great for expanding your number of HDMI ports.  I bought this when I had one HDMI port go out and had too many devices to attach.  This works fine and the automatic switching to whichever device is on works like a charm.  It is an attractive unit and allows me to run 2 console game players, dvd player, Roku, etc. without problems.  The only reason I dropped it by one star is that I could never get the remote control to work but it is really not required as the unit picks up which device is powered on.  If you have more stuff than ports, this is the answer.",negative
"So I've had this outlet strip for a few months and all it does is sit on my work bench. I haven't installed it yet. Hell, I haven't even attempted to plug it in. I do not regret the purchase; I regret my procrastination.<br /><br />Solid physical construction.",positive
"Bought this used and except for some minor cosmetic discoloration, these headphones function exceptionally well. I didn't splurge to get the newer model of the Momentums, but for what I use it for, they perform very well. I have an Android phone and even though the buttons are functional for iphones, but still am able to use the Google Now talk function and I am able to operate the phone in this manner. But really, I use the phone as I normally would using the touchscreen interface. One caveat with having conversations on the phone is that although you can clearly hear the person you're talking to, it is somewhat disorienting to not be able to clearly hear yourself. But this is not a showstopper since I mainly use it for music, games, and videos/movies when can't play out loud. I have used these on an airplane to diminish the general airplane noise while airborne. It does not completely cancel out the noise, but for being a passive noise canceling headphone, it is more than enough to listen and hear what I am listening to on the plane. Overall a good headphone that doesn't get a lot of the publicity that Beats, Bose, or Sony get.",positive
"Very hassle-free, plug the wires together, insert the mock battery into the battery compartment and turn on the camera. Camera will notify that it cannot communicate with the battery but just click ok and continue onwards. Finish and turn it off. No worries about battery power anymore unless the electricity in the house trips.",positive
"Bought 2 pairs for my daughter (one after the other) and both broke within a few weeks, after normal use.",negative
"This product does not work from a Mac to our TV, which is why we purchased it. Oh well - thankfully it wasn't too spendy.",positive
It is perfect! For me there is very little static even at high volume. The sound is crystal clear!,positive
"picks up all major networks plus their sub-channels plus dozen other channels as far as 50 miles.  of course bad weather interferes, but its free tv vs $100 plus/month and all the worthless channels",negative
"Power wise it is fine but it makes it very hard to plug in anything with a new plug angle, I had to elevate it 1 inch so it would adapt to the new style plugs",negative
Great sound but terrible quality. Worked for a month and just after the return policy ended the left year stopped working. Don't waste your time. Spend the couple extra bucks for another pair.,positive
Got these as a gift for my boyfriend. i was a little worried at first because this was going to be a temporary replacement for his Dr.Dre Beats and i wasn't sure these would be anywhere near comparable to those. When he tried them on he couldn't believe how good they sounded. He loved them! the bass sounds strong and they cancel out the noise pretty well. he also loved the fact that he could use them bluetooth as the wire isnt very &#34;gym friendly&#34;. Overall good value for the price.,positive
"I got the item a day early , item is just as promised fits my 52 inch TV perfectly.",positive
"Exactly as described , on time delivery working continuously for over one month",positive
I bought 2 bulbs and the first one i put in only worked for 2 or 3 days then stopped working. So thats highly disappointing.,negative
"Attractive internet radio. Had to return it for an older model from the same company because it wasn't compatible with WPA2 WiFi networks even though the instruction manual said it was. Customer service restricted to common business hours, M-F, but they really put an effort in to help out. Bought a Grace Digital GDI-IR2600 and it connected right up. Sounds good for the price too.",positive
This speaker already stopped working after 2 months.,negative
"I don't wear headphones too often as a stay at home mom, but there are times when I just need to block the world out and go to my own place. From the moment I put the headphones on, the world starts to calm down and turn inward. They aren't noise canceling, but they do quiet the sounds of 3 preschoolers yelling at each other. And once the music starts playing, I don't hear anything else. Ahhh....bliss.<br /><br />The headphones are very comfortable. I wore them for a couple of hours with no discomfort and could have worn them longer, but I can't shut out the world forever.<br /><br />The sounds were amazing. I have listened to a few songs many many times and never heard some of the small quiet sounds in them. I had no idea! I am no audiophile, but I do love listening to music and really hearing all the nuances.<br /><br />Great headphones that are a little pricey, but worth it if you wear headphones for long periods of time and want to block out other noises around you. These would have been awesome in my days at my desk job as a systems engineer.",positive
"Garbage..didn't work, defective item.  What a wasted of $18!  I really do not want the whole experience of boxing it back up and shipping it back to the seller so I'm just going to toss it in the trash.  You've been warned!",positive
"I ordered this and with Prime got it in two days. I had my brother help me out since my 55 inch is too large for me to handle. You'll need a phillips head for the regular screws, a level, a drill with an attachment to make pilot holes, and a socket wrench for the lag bolts. Assembly was easy enough once we figured out which screws to use for the back of my tv. Installation seems secure. The only drawback is that the spacers are too large. I wish they were half as thick so I could have used them with the large screws. I had to use the medium length screws instead and that made for a tight fit with the cords to adjust the angle knobs and secure the bottom screws when everything was hung up. Other than that it looks amazing, is secure, and for the price you just can't beat it! Also, the directions were super easy and useful which is rare.",positive
"They're a little cheap looking (but thats understandable for the price), the sound quality was pretty good but everyone can hear what you're listening to and after about a month, they started making my music pause and activating siri every 10-30 seconds or so. I didn't use them for weeks but needed them one day and they worked fine for a while, then the next day messed up again and they've been going back and forth since. For the price, I can get over the look and fact people can hear my music, but I now can hardly use them.",positive
"Excellent for having our 55&#34; tv outside the camp, without having it permanently attached to the camper.",positive
"These ear pads are not remotely close the originals that come with the cans. They are not as stuffed with material, but can fully encompass your ears which is something the originals usually didn't do.",positive
Bought this to use a USB in the aux input of my 2010 Jeep Patriot but neither work. Completely useless,negative
Headphones work great but they are not very durable about a week after owning them they got dropped and broke the power button. So no more bluetooth. Other then that they still work good when plugged in.,positive
Such a steal! Way cheaper than the ones you find at the big box stores. Fairly easy to install and sturdy! Now i can watch my TV up high and move to my liking. How awesome is it that it also comes with an HDMI?,positive
"Excellent headphones, especially with Apple devices",positive
"I purchased this speaker for a friend and I gave it four stars although it's a very good product for the price and it worked great for the most part, I will be return do to frequent bluetooth disconnects.",positive
description of the items is not true to what I wanted. it said the item was a splitter but it is not therefore I did not get what I wanted.,negative
i loved this product at first however a few days in it stopped working i kept having to switch the usb ports,positive
"Absolutely terrible. These things came tangled, the plastic ear pieces kept coming off, and they stopped working a month in. Don't bother with these.",negative
under normal circumstances i would give them 5 stars since ink'd are my favorite earbuds but i ordered 2 of these and the mic came broken on both. on one the mic cover snaps off and on the other one it simply broke in half otherwise they are great,negative
"Didn't work for me at all and for some channels it seemed to lower the signal quality. And yes, I did place 75 ohm terminators on the unused connections. I contacted Amazon and they allowed me to return the item for a full refund. Thanks Amazon!!",positive
Almost too noise cancelling... I tend to run at night and my friend was calling out to me but I was unable to hear her- I didn't realize how strong the noise isolating feature would be. They stay in great when I run though!,positive
"I was very fond of these for a long while, until I grew tired of continuously having to buy replacements for various issues.  One earbud would go out and the other would still work, wiring would be pulled loose from its root or other random area, one earpad was entirely too soft for its own good and would rip whilst I was ever so gently trying to replace it for another size.  After I sat down and thought about how much more money I could throw away buying pair after pair to replace the last, I decided to cut my losses and buy an expensive pair of noise cancelling earbuds that would last me five times longer than three pairs of these combined.  And indeed they have--far exceeded I might add.<br /><br />Note:  The only reason I am giving this three stars is because these headphones did get me through many sleepless nights, for which I am ever grateful, but hindered me greatly whenever they broke.",positive
This product does not fit in the Soundcast system. I returned the first one I paid for and the second is exactly the same.<br />The unit continually pops out of the sound jack. Just completely mis-engineered. I can't believe that Soundcast puts their name on this product.<br />DO NOT PURCHASE.....,negative
"I got this for my wife, and she loves it.<br /><br />I have a problem with it because every time I plug it into my computer it creates phantom files which I have to spend a couple of hours getting rid of.  I have tried to alter the settings to what other electronic devices use on the computer to no avail.  This is why I gave it two stars, if my wife didn't like it, the rating would be one star.<br /><br />The solution I have come up with is to load the all the music I can on this, and plug it into the wall charger for it to charge.  Not an elegant solution but it keeps the files off the computer and it seems to work.",negative
"received this whit high expectations. the volume control is awful. i could not hear the volume of the ipad over my own breathing. also tried it on my laptop and received no better results. very disappointed and had to stop at a store on the way to vacation to get another pair for my daughter. If i still had the packaging, i would definitely be trying to return.",negative
Connect easily and the effect is good. But also disconnect easily if you don't use it for several minutes.,positive
"I received my Jarv NMotion head phones quickly, I was not sure what to expect when I first ordered them as I have never heard of them before, but I was very surprised they fit perfect and sounded way better then I had expected. I use mine in the gym on the tread mill as well as the weight machines and have never had a problem with them staying in or shorting out from sweet. They were easy to pair to my iPhone and to my surprise they do not lag behind when watching YouTube or other videos unlike my last pair of blue tooth head phones I owned that I won't mention. Over all I am very happy and will probably be buying a set for my wife.",negative
"Perfect for what I need but, if you lose the remote your screwed! Doesn't work with most programmable remotes except for programmable Logitech ones.",positive
Not liking it it falls off the wall the stickers peal paint,positive
Really upset because it came with a broken charger. I just opened the package and Im really upset about it. Other than that it looks ok. I wish I would have been able to use it today.,negative
"Never seen one of these before, but we love it!  Works perfectly!",positive
"It was ok, i mean i wasn't expecting much for the price i got it at... I guess in that aspect, if exceeded my expectations bc the earphones and charger were top notch and the ipod itself was in pretty good condition, only light scratches and scuffs on the edges. My only problem, now that I've been using it for awhile, is the battery life.... It doesn't matter if i charged it fully the day before, when i try to use it, it says &#34;no battery&#34; and shuts off. Idk how to feel at the moment. :/",positive
If you are getting these for anything other than very light use I highly advise higher quality. Broke within 4 days.,positive
"The concept is great, and the headband was comfortable, but mine stopped working after a month of use. Waste of money, in my opinion.",positive
"I got a lemon. The connection randomly goes in and out, even when it's plugged in to something sitting on a stationary table.",negative
Um...... $500 for Forza 2? What a joke. Some people just have no common sense at all.,negative
product arrived per description. lasted less than three months and now won't hold a charge. the battery it replaced lasted 5 years. now seeking a replacement.,positive
This did the trick when our bulb went out. Great cheaper alternative. It's been three months and now is getting dim when first turning on TV. Probably will need to replace again soon. Good thing I got two!,positive
"Cheap plastic, but clamps well. Plugs do not fall out.",negative
"Similar to SleepPhones, HALO headphones are contained within a headband that you wear, and two round speaker pieces that you can move around to sit over your ears.  Unfortunately, these headphones came of as being extremely similar to SleepPhones, but nowhere near as good.  The ear pieces are bulky and uncomfortable, the audio quality is less than spectacular (the sound cuts out whenever slight pressure is applied to the jack that plugs into your phone), and the headband itself can be annoying to wear.  While they're a lot cheaper than SleepPhones (~$40 compared to ~$80) the price drop does not warrant the drop in quality. I wouldn't recommend them,  This was sent to me for free in return for an unbiased review.",positive
"PROMOTIONAL PRICE PROMPTED THIS PURCHASE. VERY NICE PRODUCT, NOT TO MENTION HANDY TO CARRY STUFF...",positive
"Pros: cheap<br />Cons: flimsy quality, doesnt quite stay in place, sound is so-so, buttons not easy to operate.<br />The sounds would have glitches out of nowhere, and the voice commands were very long to operate, ended up returning it.<br />The backbeats by Plantronics ended up being a much better choice.",negative
"We tested them connected to our DirecTV receiver, and they were great! Really nice sound quality and good range of tones. However, when we connected them to the TV directly (to use Roku for content), we can't get a signal. Since most of our movie and half our TV watching is on Prime, Netflix, HuluPlus, etc from the Roku, these awesome headphones won't work for us and have to go back.",positive
"After being impressed with hearing Bluetooth speakers heard elsewhere we went shopping at Amazon for one. The OontZ was highly rated and much cheaper at us28 than others we had seen & heard. The sound quality is generally poor but consistent with its price: quite muddy and indistinct at all frequencies in my opinion. It is quite small which makes it very portable, pairs easily with your device, and gets quite loud. It would be nice if the power switch and controls were not on the rear face but on the top or side to make them easier to access. The auxiliary input is a nice feature if you have non BT devices you'd like to play through it. Did not try the onboard mic for phone calls. Overall, it is far superior to tinny and weak onboard device speakers, but by no means should the sound quality be regarded as good.",positive
"I was so devastated when I lost my last pair that I had to buy another one. Although not necessarily touted as noise cancelling headphones, they drown out the extra cacophony at work. They become slightly uncomfortable on the head after long use, but then again, I wear them for 7 1/2 hours a day. Rich base, and crisp, clear sound. Love that the wire disconnects from the headphones - you can buy another one when it goes out. Brilliant!",positive
"This thing worked fine initially for several months splitting an HDMI output from an Apple computer to two monitors in the same room.  Then I started seeing intermittent &#34;snow&#34; on one of the monitors off and on even with seemingly good cable connections.  I purchased a second one of these and after 3 months (and the ability to return it had passed--of course!) the second one stopped working altogether.  The lights were on, powered up with secure connections but neither monitor received any signal.  When I bypassed this splitter and routed the video output from the MacMini directly to one of the monitors, it worked fine, so this item was the culprit.  I'd probably stay away from this and look for a different solution to your HDMI splitting problem.",positive
"AS the title says... ZERO stars. It wouldn't even turn on. It has a color screen alright.... a BLACK one.<br />Do I seem a bit &#34;frosted&#34;? Well, I ordered this for my 4 1/2 yr. old granddaughter who waited excitedly for it to arrive. Imagine the let down when it wouldn't even work!<br />Moreover, the instructions are a joke and the part which shows the function of the buttons is for a different model!<br />I noticed last night when I was looking at the reviews again to see if I had missed something on turning it on that, as another reviewer said, ALL the positive reviews were from people who had received this gratis for reviewing it.<br />I would not impugn the integrity of the the reviewers but I'd bet that each and every one which was sent to them was checked and double checked for proper function before being sent out.<br />Oh, btw, in case someone is inclined to consider the problem &#34;operator error&#34;: I read the instructions twice, I connected the player to both a computer and a AC charger. I tried every combination I could think of for key presses.<br />When connected to the computer it did function as a USB Flash drive and I could see the sample pictures, video, and songs on it. But I could NEVER get it to show anything on its screen<br />Perhaps I got the one in a thousand that was bad............. or, more likely one of the 100 out of a thousand that is bad.",negative
"I used these in South Korea, and they worked just fine. The fit from a grounded U.S. plug was great, but fitting them into the actual pig-nose plug was a little loose and finicky. Unfortunately, I only took one of the four, so I can't say for sure that they were all like that. They did get the job done, though, so I'll recommend them for that reason alone.",positive
"The last lint free micro fiber cloth I had last 8 years of moderate use on TVs and cell phones throughout the years. Just threw the thing away because I purchased these. Big mistake as about the 5 time I used my first one, it fell apart. I look down in my lap after cleaning my phone screen, and it's all blue and one edge began falling apart. Very cheaply made",negative
"Great Bluetooth! At times spotty connection, but overall great product, connects fast and efficient.",positive
Batteries work great but the charger is worthless. Purchased these to go with my headlamp and it charges them better than to charger that came with them does!,positive
works very well with non-apple products; prompts apple products that &#34;the accessory may not be supported&#34;,negative
Bracket is easy to assemble and hang and is very sturdy and secure.  It includes tons of hardware to fit various models of TV's.  It requires some assembly but it doesn't take much time.,positive
"Did not work with iPhone, iPod, or iPad, with or without adaptors.",negative
"I bought this with high expectations and was truly disappointed. The first time I plugged this surge plus protector into my wall it sounded like an explosion, which to me signifies a short. In a matter of seconds it smelled like burned plastic and the darn thing started smoking. This is completely unacceptable since it was the first time I plugged it in and there was nothing connected to it!",negative
"I have only has this item a few days .love it so far ! Radio doesn't work well, however I didn't purchase it for the radio.",positive
"It s working like it should, some interruptions but a couple of stations I get,  even though I know the closest tower is<br />only 24 miles away.  I may not be in a direct line though so that may be my problem and not yours.  Overall I guess its<br />working as it should.<br /><br />Michael Furtado",negative
"It works exactly as described.  The mSD slot is great for expansion or moving files.  The interface is a little awkward.<br />Weighing the price into the rating, it would be 4-5 stars.",positive

"Very eye-catching design.  However, one needs a PhD. in electronics to get the time, the alarm time, the radio station, and the other functions (alarm, CD, radio) to work properly and consistently.  The instruction booklet has NO instructions for setting the time anywhere - the most basic function of this item.  And, it is impossible to keep the same radio station tuned in  - as soon as you turn off the radio the station reverts back to 85.1 FM and then when you turn the radio back on you have to spend 5 minutes scanning up to the station you want to listen to.  PLEASE manufacturers, make these consumer-friendly for everybody, not just electronic geeks!  And please include FULL instructions.",negative
the sound quality was decent but very poorly made. within 2 months of me purchasing them the sealing ripped,negative
"[[VIDEOID:fde9221eb2343a44eedc084189d59a91]]PERFECT FOR USE WITH A STROLLER AS WELL AS A BIKE!!  I am loving this Venstar Cycling Wireless Speaker!! I have been using it attached to my kids' stroller and I listen to the music that way while we are walking.  I prefer this method vs using my ear buds because I'm afraid I won't hear background noise with the ear buds.  This Bluetooth speaker has great sound quality, is a breeze to set up, AND you can even receive and make phone calls.  It comes with a remote control for quicker controls while you are riding.  I have nothing but great things to say about this wireless speaker. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",positive
"This item has not yet arrived, but may later today. This is a replacement for the identical item which I purchased about a month ago and has apparently failed. It has a 1 year guarantee (or more correctly, warranty). I did not return the prior battery as it is more trouble than it is worth, though I still have it. I will return it for inspection upon request. Meantime I will try the new one when it arrives. I did not save the shipping materials from the prior battery. The prior battery may be defective or the part which it powers may be defective. Thank you.",positive
For what I paid I thought it would be nicer. It is light and feels like plastic. Looks nice but I thought it would be of better quality.,positive

"Others have commented on the sound. You have to go into this understanding that you own a compact, countertop music system that is wireless. The sound stage, therefore, is limited. It's wattage alone will tell you it can pump out serious sound without losing clarity. It is not a sound &#34;system&#34; it is a high quality, highly powerful, countertop system.<br /><br />Having said that, it is the frustration with connections, maintaining connections, support, resetting connections, switching between types of connection etc. that is the most frustrating for me. The first system sent to me was not even uploaded with the right firmware so they sent me a new system to replace the one that was initially sent out wrong. Since then, the system has sat on my counter much more than it has been used. It is beyond frustrating that the preferred wireless system in my house is a small portable sony speaker because this thing cannot function reliably enough, nor is its system of colored buttons that may or may not blink intermittently, once, twice, green, blue, purple, orange etc, each telling a different story.<br /><br />Now, my system will not even factory reset. Put it this way, there is a reason that it no longer sells for $1,999.<br /><br />If I could get this thing to operate reliably, I would give it 5 stars. It is, in my estimation, superior to both the BEOPlay A9 and McIntosh McAire given its price point at $2,000 (each of the other two are $3,000), but I would gladly spend the extra thousand dollars on something that works reliably (likely the McAire).",negative

"I have mixed feelings about these ear phones.  The sound quality is a huge step above the standard iPhone buds, but just about anything is an upgrade to those.  There are some things that are great, but a few improvements would make these the type of quality I would expect from the Bose brand.<br /><br />The good:<br />- Stands up to sweat as advertised.  I wore these while weed-eating on a day when the temps were in the high 80s, so they definitely got wet.<br />- Stays in ears securely, though if your ears do not have pronounced ridges your performance may vary.<br />- Good sound quality, with a decent compromise between filtering out some outside noise but allowing enough in for awareness of one's surroundings.<br /><br />The bad:<br />- The cord seems flimsy and tangles easily.  I much prefer the flat ribbon type cable design used in other sports earbuds.<br />- No microphone for use with cell phones.<br />- Price point:  $150 is very high for these, considering that the sound quality is good but not stellar.  You always pay a bit extra for the Bose brand, but in the case of this product I don't think the price difference is justified.  I have Etymotic HF5 earphones that were less expensive and sound much better.<br /><br />These earphones would be a decent choice for someone who wants a respectable set of earphones for exercising and feels comfortable purchasing a well-known brand.  However, with a little research one could find comparable products for a lower price.",negative

"DO NOT BUY THIS THING -- it is almost impossible to reliably set the alarms, so it is pretty much useless.  Just to qualify myself, I took AP classes in high school, was an honor student in college, graduated from CU Boulder, and have been using a  computer as a self-employed person without an IT dept since 1983.  It took me an hour and a half to figure out how to set the alarms and then they only worked for one 24-hour cycle because it is almost impossible to figure out how to shut off the music without shutting off the alarm.  There is no way to &#34;read&#34; whether or not the alarm is actually set (they call it &#34;standby&#34;) on the front of the thing.  That is, you cannot tell whether it is in what they call &#34;standby&#34; mode by looking at the front of the thing.  And how you put it in &#34;standby&#34; (set the alarm to go off) depends on whether you have played a CD or the radio yourself (optionally) or whether it is playing because the alarm went off.  And, I repeat, you cannot tell by looking at it whether or not it is actually completely set - that is, in &#34;standby.&#34;",negative

"I got two of these thinking I was getting the ones my son has, which allow you to connect two speakers to one device, which would have allowed me to put one at each end of my house thereby getting continuous sound as I move around the house.

I got 2 of these hoping to boost my 5 Ghz signal but unfortunately I did not see any improvement. My 2.4 Ghz remained the same as with stock antennas.

I'm guessing this is what the difference is with the letter at the end of the model number. I noticed that there were four different model numbers ending with a different letter (A thru D), this one being a D. I must have an older unit that used one of the previous letters, such as A, B, or C. Be sure to check your connection and double check to make sure the one you buy matches.......or do what I did and swap the connector plates.",positive

"This antenna works consistently. A few times, I cannot get some lesser-known, international channels. There are 3 local access Korean channels that I've been able to get 95% of the time. Every so often, all 3 will be inaccessible. For the most part, the picture quality is great on every channel. I get 62 channels after my HD TV &#34;scanned&#34; for channels. It could use a longer cord since the TV is in the middle of my room, and the optimal position is next to a window and elevated. I couldn't move my TV and rearrange all of the furniture; so I raised it all the way up to the bannister of our loft. It comes with 3M stickers that are very strong and hold it in place. It just looks a bit odd. But it's thin and light, so not really a problem if we ever move. In stormy weather, the channels come in clearly about 90% of the time. A few times we've had lightning storms and a channel will not go out, but it will &#34;pause&#34; and then restart from where it left off. There are many channels that I did not know existed and it picks all of them up clearly. I've only had to reboot and unplug, then rescan, just once. I've owned this for over a month now.

However, I still think that the volume can be turned out too loud for a child so I was a little cautions with this.<br /><br />Overall these worked well, the sounds was pretty average, but great for a child headphone set.

"Year and a half.  That's what I got out of mine.  It's too cheap to think about repairing, really.  Good value for the money as long as it worked.  Some people have asked about replacing old/classic era amps with this and I did that.  Having the remote was really handy.  On the other hand, it just lacks something that the old solid state amps delivered.  It's just a little lifeless somehow by comparison.  Actually, I have an older model solid state amp that I bought on ebay recently because I wanted to set up another pair of speakers so I could enjoy the full bodied sound sometimes and other times just be lazy and work this Sherwood amp via the remote.  My Sherwood still plays through the headphone jack but no sound from the speakers.  Capacitor?  Short?  I dunno and for the price it's really not worth digging into it and certainly not worth taking to a repair shop.  I noticed some of the other reviewers say they're getting longer life out of theirs so probably just luck of the draw with me but for whatever reason a year and a half of intermittent play is all I got out of it.  Update:  Usually I seem to see 1 year warranty on just about everything.  This amp has (or had when I bought it) a 2 year warranty.  At a year and a half it developed a problem.  I sent it for repair and they did honor the warranty.  BUT at the (low) price of the amp, the shipping for this large and heavy of a box is a very large percentage of the original purchase price.  Took over a month.  It's still a very good deal if you get one that works properly for the long term.",positive

I use it mostly at work to listen to Pandora or AM radio shows so it doesn't get cranked that much.  Quality is decent and has a pretty good sound.<br />Doesn't sound as good as my Oontz Curve Plus but for $20 you can't go too wrong.  Only thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem to remember the previous volume level from when it was turned off so I have to turn it on and immediately turn it down before any sound comes out because it starts at a high volume level.,positive
"Okay, I gave these Comply T-500 Ear Tips 3 stars in the attempts that you'd listen to me.  Usually 1 star reviews are more biased and often ignored.<br /><br />To start off, these eartips are good, don't get me wrong. I purchased them to accompany my Jay Birds Blue Buds, and were thoroughly impressed upon using them the first time working out. The Bass of the headphones were really unlocked with these ear tips, and they fit comfortably and securely in my ear, unlike the traditional earphone tips that are found in the blue buds. I have smaller ears I guess, so I really wanted a good fit! Unfortunately after a few days of shoving them in and out of my ear when lifting weights, they tore completely. It rendered them impossible to use, and I had to revert to the stock earphone tips that are provided with the Blue Buds.  I'm very sad that these isolation tips tore, and maybe I'll purchase a different style of earphone tips, but definitely not the Isolation Brand.",positive

"This is a very nice and compact speaker that has good water resistance and can easily be paired with a smart phone or other bluetooth device and used as an external speaker in the shower or outside, or really in just about any reasonable environment. It has a suction cup on the back which can be used to attach the speaker to a smooth surface.<br /><br />The water resistance is stated to be IP65 here on the Amazon page, which is (in my opinion) very good. It can be deciphered as follows:<br /><br />IP65 Explanation:<br />-- IP - International Protection, standard for marking to classify the degree of protection against intrusion<br />-- 6 - first digit indicates degree of protection against solid particles, on a scale of 1 to 6 with 6 being the greatest degree of protection, described as 'dust tight' and providing no ingress of dust and complete protection against contact.<br />-- 5 - second digit indicates liquid ingress protection, on a scale of 1 to 9. The 5 indicates protection against water jets, requiring that water projected by a nozzle (6.3 mm) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects, with a test duration of at least 3 minutes and specified water volume and pressure for the test.<br /><br />Turning the speaker on or off is accomplished by holding down the power button and is confirmed by the speaker saying 'Power Off' or 'Power On'.<br /><br />I used it in the shower although my particular shower has tile walls that do not allow for the suction cup to attach securely. Otherwise, it worked fine and was not affected by the moisture or water.<br /><br />This little speaker has a very good audio quality. Of course, since it has only a single speaker, this is not a stereo speaker but the quality of the sound is very acceptable. Certainly it is considerably better than listening to something using the speakers build into most smart phones or tablets. The bluetooth profile used is A2DP (see wiki article 'List of Bluetooth profiles' for explanation, if curious).<br /><br />It arrived at least partially charged but I plugged it into one of my USB chargers for long enough to make sure that it had a good full charge (a USB charging cord is included). It can be used while plugged in and charging (but should not be plugged into a charger when in a wet environment because it's necessary to open the rubber flap that otherwise seals the USB port from water intrusion). There is no indication provided as to when the battery is fully charged or what the remaining charge might be, which is a minor deficiency. I do like the fact that a rechargeable battery is part of the speaker and it will not require periodic battery replacement.<br /><br />Instructions are included, written in mostly intelligible English (I enjoyed the statement, under 'Precaution', that \\""The Speaker has a fever phenomenon when normally operated or charging, it'  s normal\\"", which I assume means that the speaker may get warm at times when it's being used or charged.<br /><br />When paired with my iPhone the volume of the speaker is mostly controlled by the phone (there is a more limited ability to raise or lower the volume using the controls on the speaker but the range of control is less than what you get from using the controls on your phone). The speaker also has controls to pause and start playback (if playing music files, for example), and for advancing to the next track or back to the previous track.<br /><br />I will also point out that the volume ability of this speaker is moderate. It is not as loud (at full volume) as some bluetooth speakers, and the volume capability is not in my opinion sufficient to listen to this in the shower and overcome water noise adequately. It is just fine for placing on a desk or table next to where you are seated, and it will produce a comfortable volume level for normal listening. It is certainly not going to play loud enough for what many people may want for listening to music if you like to listen to music at reasonably high volume levels.<br /><br />The speaker can also be used to answer phone calls when paired with a phone - an incoming call will automatically interrupt anything playing on the speaker, and the controls can be used to answer the call, or hang up when complete.

"I love this thing. It has saved me so much time in data transfers. This brought my 2011 macbook pro right back up to the top for me.

No need to upgrade the mac now this thing saved me a ton of money, great alternative to the overly expensive and bulky thunderbolt docks that all seem to have some type of issue. The only con I can find and its the reason for 4 stars which if it would let me would be 4 and 3/4 stars is the thunderbolt cable is a little short for me.

"I am absolutely impressed by the quality sound that radiates from such a compact package. After reading reviews I was expecting good sound but never in my life would I have expected it to be this high in quality.<br />It was very easy to pair with both my phone and my laptop as well as my Ipod and the improvement it makes to my laptop that even has beats audio is astounding . The fact that you can use a sd card as well as the included Aux cord makes using this speaker super simple<br />It is just the right size to make it easily portable in my daily bag I take with to work. I work on a loud bus as a part time monitor for a pre school and this has given to me the ability to play children's music through my Ipod for the children to enjoy during their ride . This being so much safer than running a aux code over a seat. This would make the perfect gift for any music lover out there who enjoys great sound while working out,working on crafts or in the man cave.The added light show during music play is very nice and rather fun to watch in a dim lit room.

Piece of junk. My old rabbit ears brought in more channels. Better off spending $5 on regular antenna.,negative
Sound quality wasn't nearly as good as I was expecting. Especially with the great reviews here.,positive
"I own the SPBT 1032 model. For the price , its worth it.  BAss and bluetooth are good enough for a $45 product. Radio is very important to me, and this functions well. I like the fact that there are 2 mic jacks in, bcuz its good to have some redundancy built into the system.After a couple years , things can break. If I was in the market for a portable boombox, I would definitely buy this model -the 1034.<br /><br />I think this company should be supported since its providing good portable audio at reasonable prices. The concept of having subwoofers in small devices is cool. I look forward to one with an 8 inch subwoofer,and more power, even if its heavier.<br /><br />Only dislike is the button next to tuning up and down- this should be positioned somewhere els;. since it re-programs all your pre-set radio stations. It can easily be pressed in error while trying to change a radio station.",positive
Ok but wouldn't buy another pair. Maybe a different model. I had a different model of Bob Marley headphones and absolutely loved them. I thought I would get the same out of these that a got out of my last pair but was disappointed,positive
Seem to only work well with HDMI adapter. Screen keeps blinking with DVI.,negative
"I bought the Zeskit cable to use on a pair of very good headphones that came with a cable that is much too long for my day-to-day needs. I bought this cable hoping it would be a bit more convenient for listening to music as I sit at my desk. However, the Zeskit cable turned out to be a rather mixed bag of good and not-so-good qualities.<br />Pros: Sturdy, well made, good materials, should last a long time, relatively inexpensive<br />Cons: Noisy, cable is stiff and it has a lot of memory<br />Recommended with reservations. Useful for some purposes, of limited use with headphones.",positive
"These speakers are simply amazing for the price i have used them for everything. The Bluetooth quality is great, it just receives minor static interference in the non dominant speaker at times in any input and i believe its due to this feature, but its really nothing to fuss about. One thing I do recommend for someone buying these speakers is to get another Male to 2 x RCA Male Stereo Audio Cable because the one provided is pretty faulty. But nonetheless these speakers sound incredible!! and are a great buy!",positive
"Quality of light and picture were great, but it only lasted a few months before it blew up inside my tv.  I was very careful handling it, I'm a person who's handled bulbs for movie theater projectors, so I know the dangers.  It just blew up.",positive
"A very nice attractive radio, you will need to read the manual  for a lot of operations . I couldn't  receive a few of the stations that i received  before.

"The item that was delivered was correct, but it was not the right dish we needed for the system that we have.",positive
"Its nice in the kitchen , but I bought it for a way to listen to music on my Harley  Davidson, just wasn't loud enough.",positive
The bottom of my Polk Audio sub woofer was making  direct contact with the carpet. The whole floor was vibrating. Not good when you live in the 3rd floor. The spikes raised the sub woofer enough that eliminated all the vibration on the floor. Just clean base now. Build quality is good. Easy to install. Great price. Happy with the results.,positive
You should turn the plugs 90 degrees so that more items can be plugged in . . . many people need to plug in items like oversized adaptors or cords that are angled and don't come straight out of the rear of the male receptacle.

"Right off the bat I'll say that I've used an awful lot of Bluetooth Speakers and Headphones, so I guess I'm always looking for the perfect one, and the TT-SK08 could just be that. You see I need a portable speaker to connect wirelessly to my phone when I'm in the garden, working in the garage, tidying up the workshop or fixing the car.<br />This means that the speaker is going to get dirty, wet, dropped and kicked around a lot, and  so the unit I need has to be up to all that, and so far, this speaker from Taotronics is just that.<br />The battery lasts long enough, the speaker is loud and has plenty of bass, and I haven't been able to break it yet (and neither has my son) so it's recommended, and I'd like to thank Taotronics for sending me one to review.",positive
The third Q/A in this product page indicates that the remote of a Beats headphones will work with this extension. This is not true. The cable is only for audio. I will return.,positive
"I bought these earbuds on sale because I wanted to give Sennheiser earbuds a try. After all, Sennheiser is one of the top audio brands out there. It seems that these earbuds were on sale for a few reasons, however.<br /><br />Although these earbuds have good highs, the medium, lows, and bass were somewhat lacking. The earbuds had to be worn in the correct position (to get the full quality sound and bass), which meant that most of the time, the music that I listened to sounded lackluster. The wiring was very thin, and thus seemed somewhat flimsy, although this was never a real issue. The material of the wire casing, however, was this sticky, rubbery type of sheath that would just  kinda stick to my hands whenever I would accidentally brush them, often causing the earbuds to fly out of my ear and slam onto the floor. Like all other earbuds that I have gone through, these ones would fall off my ears whenever they picked up sweat, which became (somewhat annoying, but bearable, since this happens to be almost all the time, anyway.)<br /><br />The primary reason I gave this pair a 2 star rating out of 5 was because of the fact that in addition to all of the aforementioned things, these buds were ready for the electronic scrapyard after 3 months of use. When put into abusive hands, these earbuds probably would last a month, and that would be it. Overall, if you are looking for a pair of buds that are durable, have good sound quality, rugged wiring, and don't have to be worn in a PERFECT POSITION ALL THE TIME TO GET THE RIGHT SOUND, get another pair.",positive
"This little speaker is really quite nice. The sound is great, and I like the way it can close down to such a compact size.  I have not tried connecting multiple speakers, so cannot comment on that.  I only gave it 4 stars because the little tabs that allow the speaker to lock into it's compact position broke off within the first 3-4 uses.  I don't know if others have had this problem.  I don't think it is due to rough handling, because I have not had this breakage problem with the tabs of the little iHome speakers that expand and fold up like the AYL.  Still, I like these AYL speakers and would recommend them with the suggestion to be SOOO CAREFUL when closing it up.",positive
"Great speakers, I bought 2 pair of these for my front highs and my surrounds. this with the Center channel and towers makes for an awesome sounding system. love it. I attached a test screen after i calibrated these speakers in my system, using them 80 Hz and above.",positive

"These are pretty good headphones, but consider them disposable. I'm getting ready to buy the 3rd pair in 1.5 years.",positive
The worked well for a while.  But one of the buds stopped working altogether after about 2 years usage.,negative
The left earbud stopped working the 2nd day of use. A week later it stopped working completely. I expected that for the price though.,positive
Ordered the speaker and it came in two days. Sounds really good by aux chord and had no problems with anything and bass thats good. Cuts off multiple times when using by Bluetooth. Barely works four feet away if something or you are in between it. Randomly disconnected from Bluetooth when I wasn't touching anything.Will be returning. Strongly recommended not to buy I don't know why it has such a high rating,positive
"A very nice piece of equipment, sturdy, large, well made.  It is very light, so installation was easy off of a ladder, and worked like a charm, got 22 stations in immediately.",positive
Was. Not what I expected thought it would be a little louder,positive
Good sound and compact construction.  Not the most comfortable for my ears.,positive
"Almost impossible to fit into a standard receptacle box if you have 2 sets of wires. It can fit, but will stick out a little. Hopefully future models can be downsized to accommodate wiring/wire nuts. Aside from that, works fine.",negative
basic and reasonably priced. good for my son to take to camp,positive
Nice design but didn't work for me.  I am arguably at the outside edge of its range hence the neutral rating,negative
"These are ok headphones for sound, they have a bass profile so if you're listening to more bass heavy music they filter better for that. The microphone quality works, I usually ended up holding it closer to my mouth so people could hear me, but good for the price point.<br /><br />The problem is the headphone jack is of exceptionally poor quality.  I have purchased two pairs of these headphones and the jack has broken off at the  base twice. Once with me turning my head, and the other with me putting my phone down next to me. I now have the problem of the jack being lodged in my iPhone's port and I can't get it out, which is causing a bunch of problems for my phone. Either I have to replace the phone or figure a way to get it out. I will never buy again.",negative
"Screen looks great!  Instructions not very clear but product is well made and solid.  Only negative is the mounting kit seems weak considering the  amount of weight required and the holes are not pre-drilled.  I didn't like the idea of drilling into the aluminum frame, afraid I might damage it or weaken it.",positive
the product came quickly and as described.i did not like the way the player worked i was used to my Zen player but for the price it did what it saidt,negative
This receiver only works 20% of the time. First week was excellent after that it's bs,positive
"Cable stopped working after only 2 weeks of usage, even when it works, it flickers.  Don't waste your money on this cable.  Now I'm stuck with this non working cable which I can't do much with.",positive

"Can't live without my cover.  It's the best investment I have made for my iPad.  I use it every single day and in my car as well.  I have a part in my dash that I can fit the handle and it stays in place.  Can't recommend this enough.  It fits the iPad Air 2 very snuggly and doesn't pop out at all.  I've owned several of these for the older iPads, mini included and they are all going strong with their new owners and they love the stand as well as I do.",positive
The lamp go out too fast. Had to replace twice within 6 months from the same shipper.,positive
"This speaker looks very sleek --definitely something that I would proudly take with me and show my friends.<br /><br />Doing the pairing with my phone (Samsung S5) was really easy. All I had to do was turn it on, listen for it to say &#34;pairing&#34; and then connected the BT from my phone. It didn't ask for the pin number, but the instruction manual provided a number in case. I did notice that when you are turning the BT on your phone on/off or turning the speaker on/off, you have to reconnect the speaker. When the speaker is connected with BT, a flashing blue light will turn on on the face of the speaker. It flashes only intermittently so it doesn't really bother me.<br /><br />*1 issue with pairing is that apparently you can pair 2 devices with the speaker at once? The manual mentions it but doesn't give any instructions as to how to do it. I don't really see the point in this though since I just want 1 device playing so it doesn't really matter to me.<br />*Another issue with pairing is that I can't figure out how to pair another device in place of the device I already have paired with it.<br /><br />I also really like that the speaker has sticky pads on the bottom so there's no fear of it sliding all over the place!<br />The speaker also allows for calling with its speaker and a built-in mic. When someone calls you, it's easy to pick up with just the mic itself!<br /><br />Connectivity is alright and that's why I'm knocking a star off. Inside, walls aren't a big issue, though there is just 1 room where if I stand there and the speaker is somewhere else, the music will become choppy. I also took it to the beach where my phone was no more than 5 ft from the speaker at all times and there was also an issue with connectivity.<br /><br />Other reasons why I'm knocking off another star is because 1) There is no battery indicator anywhere on the speaker --not when I'm using it or when I'm charging it. 2) The buttons are easy to press but they are not very sensitive.<br /><br />TLDR: This speaker looks great, has great sound, but some of its features are more difficult to use than advertised.",positive
"The part that goes into your eat canal have an oval shape and I think that causes a little of the discomfort. I guess while trying to fix something that wasn't broken, they made it worse.<br />The biggest problem: the &#34;soft&#34; rubber isn't as soft as my Samsung's and this is probably the big reason why it hurt to wear.<br /><br />The oval might be a good idea if the earphones were not allowed to rotate in the ear but stuff happens.<br />These are inexpensive and if you're buying to replace your broken ones, you can probably reuse the in ear rubber from your old one.",negative
"I bought these for my son for a trip to his Aunt's house.  They worked fine for about a month then all of the sudden he could only hear music but not lyrics.  After careful inspection, i found the connection at the plug was bad.  If you held it in the right place you could hear everything.  Possibly just a bad pair of headphones as the &#34;minion&#34; version of the same headphones for my other son works fine after a year of use.",negative
"*Update: support contacted me and was very open to my feedback. Fully refunded the cost and offered add'l free products. Please note, the price / quality is solid - just dont expect the world for $25.<br />----------<br /><br />- Please read the other 1 star reviews<br />- It is rather flimsy<br />- The horizontal bars consist of two pieces, making it nearly impossible to horizontally align and level the mount<br />- The vertical brackets stick out above the TV (Samsung un40h5500): this is bad!<br />- Can't lock the TV in place (horizontally)",negative
Total piece of crap. Your better off moving your TV up to a higher location :) I got less channels with this installed. Looks like it was made in a 3rd world country with a pair of scissors.,positive

"When it works it's great. Unfortunately it only charges some of the time. I nearly returned it, but then I noticed it started charging again, but it's right back to not charging. I should have just sent it back.",positive

"[[VIDEOID:584eef4379acc3fa39afab47c6ced30c]] hit the ball out of the field on these headphones. They are very light and not bulky on your head. The sound quality is great and the operation is very easy. I paired them with two different computers and then my iPhone 6, flawless operation. Since they fold they are compact enough to use when I travel. If I had to have a negative it would be the speaker quality on my phone when the person with the headset is talking, but that's true of all headsets IMHO. I was given the product at a reduced price to give my honest evaluation.",positive
"Update from Jan 2016:<br />I worked with Eric at Maha customer support and they replaced my defective unit under warranty back in August/Sept. of 2015.  The replacement unit is working fine and is a quality product.  While not completely pain free, Maha did what they promised and I appreciate a company that stands behind their products.  I will buy from them again, and highly recommend you give them a look if you need their products.<br />I will be increasing my rating to 4 stars.<br /><br />Just an update:<br /><br />I purchased this from Amazon in May 2014.  It has performed really well and would normally recommend this to everyone.  However, it has stopped working this week.  It comes with a 3 year warranty and I am attempting to get it replaced under that warranty.<br /><br />I will update this review based upon the response I get from Maha.",negative
"These seem to be a good, affordable alternative to the Sennheiser brand.  It did take 2 people to get them on though.  One person to hold the earpiece and the other person to carefully work the new ear pad over it.  Once they are on, it's all good.  Very comfortable and the true sound comes thru clearly.",positive

"I purchased these glasses for use with a Sony TV, but they would not function.",positive
"Practical solution for a side access electrical outlet.  Disappointed that, even though it provides a screw hole, no screw was provided.  I had to buy a box of #6 x 32 screws at 2&#34; length to secure them to the plug.  This device will probably hold OK without the screw but since I was placing these behind hard to move heavy furniture I wanted the added security.  I like the fact that this device provides current access from both the top and bottom existing plugs.  If your outlet has half of the receptacle on a switch you would have to trace the circuitry in this device to figure out which plug services a particular outlet.  I didn't have that problem.",negative
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.,positive
"The mount looks like it works great. I would say that it works great, but i haven't been able to mount it yet, because all of the 100 screws it comes with don't work!!! It comes with 4 (or more) different sizes of screws to mount the backplate to your tv...one of the sizes fit the thread but it was half the length needed! Even wothout the optional provided plastic spaces, the screw barely reached from the plate to the tv. I don't know how this brand expects half inch screws to hold a 25lb tv with the screws provided. I am having to pick up a huge box of screws at the hardware store tomorrow just for this project....<br /><br />Other than that... i hope this mount works great, because i have high expectations for it",positive

"These plug adapters are cheap, but they are of correspondingly poor quality. We bought two sets of four. The adapters have poor or loose electrical contacts, so we have to jiggle the plugs to get current. Once the current is flowing, the slightest touch will break the connection. Three of the eight work reasonably well; the other five are pretty dismal. On one of the plugs, one of the three prongs that is supposed to go into the wall outlet is really loose.  I would not recommend these, even at the bargain prices at which they are sold; it's a pity.",negative

Product works fine.  Not as good as a larger theater package.  Battery for remote was dead and optical cable stopped functioning the 2nd day.  The accessories need to be replaced by manufacturer.,positive
"Where do I begin? Ok item arrived on time, opened the package, dirt on volume control part, well that's okay I paired with different devices ( my iphone, ipad and ipod) on bluetooth. Not only static noise while playing songs, It doesn't even keep staying connected longer than 30 seconds which means I have to manually reconnect blutooth back and forth. OMG I'm not jokin, I could not believe what I was doing. It seemed like it would take 5 hrs to play one song from one device plus static noise on. What do I do with this?. Returning",negative

Now, the plug fits perfectly and I can enjoy these headphones. But it's strange: no other headphones have been a problem with this case. Hopefully, this info is helpful to someone.",positive

Exactly what I needed to hook up my PS4 to an old 19&#34; monitor for college. Got the job done.,negative
Decent set of headphones for the price but as you should expect the quality is not great.  I use these for working out so I won't damage a good set of headphones.  For the price I paid I am satisfied.,positive

"I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review. The unit is what I purchased but the batteries come separate. I bought some rechargeable batteries and charged it after putting it to use in the television remote. When it was getting low, I placed it in the charger and waited for the process to begin. It lights up and has an indicator that displays how folat along you are in the charging process. I really liked this and indicated when the charging is completed. It took a little while to charge though but it's understandable since my last used to take an entire night to charge. Good product and it's not built flimsy.",positive
Bougt refurbished one that died on the thrid use. Bought a brand new one that has a defective right channel. This is a piece of crap.,positive

"Ordered this product and within a couple of weeks it would no longer turn on. LOTS of information online about different hoodoo and voodoo that can be done to bring it back to life and none of it worked. I returned for replacement thinking that it was just a one-off misfit. The second one started acting strangely within a couple of weeks and was still functioning most of the time so I kept it. The hello screen would not come on and the book/music last being listened to would start anyway. The menu and select buttons would simply stop working and then out of the blue 10 or 15 minutes later the whole thing would rapid fire through all commands it had previously gotten. At times the screen would flash goodbye and just shut down and when I turned it on it would be back where I had started it before, sometimes HOURS earlier. I should have given up then and mailed it back because there is a 30 day return policy and these have been discontinued by the manufacturer. I am right back where I started with the first one. NOTHING turns it back on. Occasionally plugging it in to a computer will prompt it to say goodbye or to indicate that it is charging, and no amount of reset or other commands bring it back to life. I'm an old person who is using this sitting still and plugging it in to charge in safe computers. It has only ever downloaded books from Audible. There is absolutely no reason to suspect that my lifestyle or use of this machine killed it. These are just VERY fragile and buggy and should not be purchased. Let the remaining stock be sent to people patient enough to keep trying to return and replace them. Find something better for your $70 and if you have already purchased one, do NOT tolerate the bugs. Replace as soon as it starts acting strangely or you're going to be out your money.",positive

"Great headphones! Works great for travel. Although I thought they had volume control because of the picture of the headphones on Amazon. Not sure why there is the little connector looking thing on the wire int he picture because there is nothing like that on the actual wire. Feel a little deceived by that, but it's my own fault for not reading the product description.",positive

"Horrible sound. I am surprised, as I saw so many positive reviews.<br />I spent almost a day adjusting EQ to make it acceptable.<br />So far, the bass was heavy, pumping and muttering.<br />But that's not the worst (it could be acceptable for fans of heavy bass). The mids are disgusting. For example, I had to turn the 1K line almost all the way down.<br />The highs are almost ok, but I had to increase it a bit to make the sound clear.<br />Regardless of all the actions, I still hear that the sound is not perfect and feels a bit &#34;round&#34;. The sound scene is very compact, it's like a tiny room where all the action happens.<br />In addition, the remote control button is very hard to press, so sometimes fingers erroneously perform extra pressings.<br />The cable does not seem sturdy enough and I expect it to break soon (especially near the jack - classic).<br />Will never buy it again. Disappointment worth $80",positive
I have to fiddle with a couple of them just a little to get stereo but 5 for that price is still a great buy.,positive
"Some online reviews found these quite good regardless of price.  Owning only audiophile headphones and wanting a rough and ready headphone on the go, I decided to try these.  Utterly average, actually below average.  Koss makes better though of cheaper build quality sounds significantly better, costs about the same.  Just don't believe the hype, they aren't that good, they are OK.  Good enough to get it done, cheap enough, no big deal to loose.",positive
These headphones have wood canals for a unique sound experience.  However the wood split and fell apart in a month's ownership of light usage.,negative

NOCS sent me a very curt, rude email saying that they can 'clearly see extreme wear' in the picture I sent them.

"It's not outputting audio for me. I tried both the TV and a separate audio system. If I unplugged one of the split cables, the audio starts working, but with both in it loses all audio.  Edit: My guess is it's outputting audio to one device (that doesn't use audio), and giving it priority over the TV, with no means of switching them. I tried switching ports, powering them on separately, and other random combinations. Nothing worked. Only unplugging the non-audio device lets the TV have it.",negative

"I should have paid closer attention to other negative reviews... headphones had great sound and worked fine when in a gym environment (elliptical, treadmill, weight lifting) when my phone was stationary on the gym equipment.  However, when walking with phone in pocket, the bluetooth continued to get interference and was very annoying.  I took the phone out of my pocket and carried in my hand and it still continued to drop connection (about once every 10-15 seconds).  I also tried with my wife's phone and had same issue.",positive

These replacement cushions are easy to install and are comfortable like the originals. The sound quality seems to be as good as the OEM as well. After only 2 months the cushion is splitting. The original cushions lasted several years. This is my second attempt at finding a durable replacement. I am disappointed that they are ripping.,negative
"cheap, cheaply built.  Sound quality is okay, but range is piss poor.  You're looking looking at about 12 ft max with line-of-sight.  If anything gets in between the sending unit and the receiver, signal breaks up.<br />Pairing fast, no probs with dropped pairing, just crappy signal reception",positive

"It is a LARGE case.  Your precious parrot will be safe from damage here.  Not waterproof, but i wasn't looking for it.  The flimsy cloth bad that comes with the headphones is just not the way to go.  This contains a handy inner zipper case for whatever wires you want to bring (charging and a headphone wire).  I also squeezed an extra battery and the external charger in there so I am combat ready for those flights to China. A bit pricey, for what the phones cost, should come with a discount or something.  No, you can't stand on it, but no worries about dropping onto hard floors.  The phones are not secured in there and the zipper opens all the way so be ready for your headphones to fall right out upon completion of opening.  It's the only way to go, so just buy it with the headphones.  As a percentage of the headphone cost, you won't notice the price jump when you add it to your cart.",negative
"I really like the dynamo to crank up a charge when mains power is not available, like in emergencies. That is about the best thing I can say about this unit.We got it in order to have a radio in our emergency-prparedness kit for news or weather when needed (we recently moved to the San Francisco Bay Area from Portland, so &#34;The Big One&#34; is never far out of mind). However, we tried using it as a regular radio and it is just terrible for that. First of all, we bought an AC power adapter (sold separately!) And there were warnings about leaving it plugged in more than 3 hours to charge with the radio off, but turning the radio on while plugged into mains power makes a horrible, overpowering interference-type noise. So, despite the warnings, I let it charge overnight, and THEN it was *finally* usable as a standalone radio (assuming  one can figure out the weird &#34;power select&#34; knob, which does not seem ti operate according to the labrls printed on the case)! My only luck was randomly clicking the dial through all its stops and pressing the power button st the top-right corner until the radio came on... that very day, we decided to get a normal standalone radio and ordered a ([ASIN:B001BGGD8A]), with which we are very happy.",negative
"The first one I received was a used one that someone tried to glue the stand on but failed. I do not blame Amazon for this. It also did not have the correct screws to connect the stand hence the person tried to glue it to no avail. The second one that I received worked but the screws to mount the stand were loose in the box and could have easily been lost because of this, I just happen to hear them rattling around and found them. I almost sent it back because I could not find the screws to mount the stand. There was however two screws in a plastic bag that were dry wall screws to mount the antenna to the wall. These screws are too feeble to mount in dry wall so give them a miss. The two screws that were rattling around should have been in a plastic bag. The problem with the screws means I can only give it three stars. The first one also had a screw that was broke off in the stand screw holes. Trek should provide better information on the screws as I think some people put the wrong screws in the wrong hole. As far as reception is concerned I now get channel six here in Philadelphia which I did not get with the Terk model HDTVA which cost 10 dollars more. The problem with the HDTVA model I believe was due to AC component getting into the amplifier because because of the wall mount power supply cube heat buildup which will degrade the filter capacitors ability to keep AC from the DC. I bought 6 of the HDTVA models that each only lasted one year. I will add to this review if I experience the same problem with this model.",negative
Only lasted for about 6 months. USB connection side started to fail as it would only work when I put force against the connection. Sound quality was alright being that it's wireless. This was used in my car as my car's bt would not stream music.,positive
I like the look of the 1960s style but from a distance because up close you can see that it is cheap plastic. I had some trouble at first because it spun too fast and my record sounded like it was being sung by minions. I got it to slow down by manually giving the record friction. It played a record. It had nice sound. I was pleased. The next time I tried to use it I couldn't get it to spin at all no matter what I tried. The aux function still works so I could use it as a decorative speaker for my iPhone but it isn't worth the price for that and I still need a record player.,positive
Mediocre at best. It's functional... nothing to write home about.,positive
"It's a really great turntable, but unfortunately they are (which I'm finding out far too late) notorious for having issues with the anti skate. I don't know how it took me so long to realize the issue, but the anti skate does not work at all.",positive
Pretty cool little radio. Panel and spot lights are a nice touch. Missing a star due to the very light plastic it's made of. You will need to be careful with the unit. Not a rugged device. Not made for the trail/road.,negative

"When I have it plugged into my Blu-Ray DVD player (Sony) and am watching a movie or Netflix, the screen intermittently goes black and then comes back on! This is the second switch I have purchased and will not be getting another (the other being a much cheaper model that went out). When I hook my DVD directly into my TV it works fine! My reason for purchasing was because I only have 2 HDMI ports on my TV and I have three components that I need hooked up to it; a Chromecast, AT&T Uverse box and my DVD player. I am so disappointed!",negative
Sound is great!  The only negative thing I have to say is that the Bluetooth is weak.  Range is 25 feet or less.,positive
"The headphones sound pretty good for a set of kids headphones. However the comfort level isn't that great. They just have typical foam pads which don't really encapsulate the ear. His other ones are the plasticy leather which feels much better over a long period of time. I compared his two pairs of kids headphone laying on the couch listening to the same song, and then placed the headphones up to a dB meter for the duration of the song. His first pair limited the output to 82dB, this pair from Philips which is allegedly limited to 85dB had a max output of 93dB. Both pairs were exceptionally loud to me. The CDC says that listening to sounds above 85dB for a prolonged period will cause hearing damage. Most likely you will be near enough your child though to turn down the volume for them.",positive
After carefully reviewing similar products I decided upon this one. I'm very sorry that I did. Perhaps I got a defective one but this item did absolutely nothing when installed. A complete waste of money. This was my first ever bad buying experience on Amazon.,negative
This worked great for about 2 months and now all the sudden doesn't work. It seems I'm out of the timeframe where I can return it but I'd expect it to function longer than 2 months.,positive
I ordered these to put on my Bose SoundTrue earbuds and they dramatically increased the sound quality! They also seem to stay in my ear better and cancel out noise. These are now my favorite earbuds so far! (order the same size in the SoundStay Plus as you use in the SoundStay),positive
"Bought Dec 6, 2014 and worked great until today... Now, the charger no longer charges and will not power the unit with the battery slide switch in OFF position. Checked the charger with a Volt Meter to be at 12.5 Vdc even with a 10 Ohm power resistor connected to it. Which means that the problem is in the Max A34. Not very easy to take apart as everything is glued with a soft glue gun. Now it is an expensive paper weight. Doubt 1 year warranty is worth anything, but will look into it. Cannot recommend this product based on this experience.",positive
"I looked at the reviews before buying and was a little hesitant with some of the negative reviews. They were a good price and had the BOSE name so I decided to try them out.<br />The sound is really good for my interests. They do sound much better then my cheap pair on ear and so much better then my in ear Seinheiser.<br />I haven't experienced any &#34;leakage&#34; that other reviewers have. There is some with the volume turned all the way up and the headphones sitting on my desk, but I don't listen with the volume turned that far up - I value my hearing.<br />They are comfortable to wear, the ear pieces are very comfortable for me and they are light weight.<br /><br />The bad part: The cable is crap. Utter crap. I ordered these and the sound didn't work on one side so I wiggled the cable near the jack that goes into the computer and the sound worked on both sides. Wiggle it again and the sound goes out. The replacement cable is way to expensive for replacing so I returned the pair and got a new pair.  These work better and I'll be reinforcing the cable.<br /><br />Over all. Well. I can't believe BOSE would bring such a dysfunctional piece of equipment to market like this. But reinforcing the cable will work and for the price it's ok. For those people using these very frequently I would recommend spending the extra money on something else. For those like me that use them at work they will be just fine.",negative
These are disgusting - they are off-gassing so severely that I won't have them in my house - I'm throwing them away. You get what you pay for.,positive

"The antenna works very well, depending on where you live, I was able to receive 66 channels in 94127 and 26 channels in 80303.",negative
Fast service. I got the 35 mile antenna and we receive several channels for free now. This is so easy to set up - plug the cable end into your cable spot on your tv and put the antenna (size and weight of thick paper) up high or near a window for best reception. No electricity is needed. Well worth $15 to receive free tv.,positive
Worked one month then just stopped. Not worth it. Shame too cause it sounded great.,positive
"I took this on a 7-week trip and by the time I got back, it was too late to return it. It's basically useless. The solar charger is a joke, the light is too dim, and when you crank it (per the instructions), it barely holds a charge long enough to turn the radio on. I wouldn't use this thing for any kind of emergency. SAVE YOUR MONEY!",negative
"Item does work for JBL onbeat, though the adapter does fall out of the unit if it is moved.",negative
They sound good but my big ears get tired of it after about an hour. The cord comes out both sides and is super long. So you can leave it pluged in and walk across the room.,positive
The device as a whole works well. I have noticed at times that the &#34;2.4A&#34; ports don't seem to put out that much all the time. I've run some measurements on my phone and sometimes I would get less than an amp and others I would get around 2. This variance isn't predictable by any means I've seen but it does cause problems when I need to charge a nearly dead phone quickly. I've found myself using a usb charging adapter in the 3 prong plugs if I need to ensure a quick charge. The form and weight of it work well with my situation. I have it positioned under my couch so my wife and I can use it whilst watching TV. It's convenient for this.,negative
Sound is excellent but radio reception is fair. For the $500 price tag you'd think BOSE would include the external antenna instead of having you buy a $10 ad on antenna.,positive
"I love these, super accurate sound with bass! Don't understand the purpose or reason for one side longer than the other, I've read about exercise and you can wrap it, but I don't care, should of just left normal design. It does feel a bit plasticty, but amazing sound. Take care because I feel it could break easily & one side always falls out",positive
"I was looking for the speaker. I guess I didn't fully read the discription, therefore I had to return the product.",negative
I bought these to extend my sound system's reach. With relative ease I was able to brake them apart using some pliers. I can't tell if there is any sound distortion from these but I am not an audiophile and the price was the best I could find.,positive
"Awesome / Vibrant / Neat Gadget.  Enough volume for the apt / house.  Myself was looking for something extra loud for the beach.  Not as loud as i wanted for the outdoors.  Plenty of volume when no one is around, but once the area gets filled with people the music can't hardly be heard...",positive
Did not know I would have to have 2 equalizers for this to work. Disappointed :(,negative
Good sound but I personally can't stand the way your supposed to wear them.,positive
"For the most part this adapter worked in the sense that I saw an image on my monitor, but there were a plethora of green speckles whenever the image on the monitor varied too much.  For windowed applications where the screen is mainly just one or two colors it worked well, but for my desktop background and/or games with lots of colors, there were random sparkling green pixels everywhere.  With both a window and my desktop background visible the green speckles only appeared on the colorful image of the desktop, even as I moved the window around.<br /><br />Perhaps there is a resolution limit (I was using 1920 by 1200), or the adapter I used is malfunctioning, but in either case it is more or less unusable.  This was my backup plan for an HDMI -&#62; HDMI mini adapter since the video card I needed to plug an HDMI cable into had both types of connectors; luckily the HDMI mini port worked so I didn't need to rely on the DVI adapter.",positive

"This universal remote was easy to set up for a Samsung HDTV and BluRay player. Even though it says that you can directly dial up subset digital channels like 12.1, 12.2 and 12.3, I could not seem to get it to do that for me. The listed dimensions are awfully far off, in fact they must be for the entire blisterpac packaging. So a bit bigger remote was expected and maybe somewhat easier to use. So far my mother is finding this easier to use that the multi-button small remote that came with her equipment.",negative
"This is definitely not authentic so the color red is shades off. For the price, however, you can not go wrong to resurrect a pair of broken & expensive headphones. This gets them back in working condition and then you can sell them or give them to your kids while you now justify the price of an upgrade to a newer edition set of Beats.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in to know that Beats, and now Apple, haven't recognized that this expensive product has an defect that causes many folks to experience breakage in the same place. The volume of complaints I see here on Amazon definitely support that this is a design weakness.<br /><br />Overall. I am appreciative that this replacement part is available, with logos and branding.",negative
"Works changing the volume for my surround sound, but doesn't control all Sony surround sound options for my model. Have to switch back and forth between BD and Surround sound just to change the volume. Less options than my original surround sound remote.

These are a little flimsy as well. So you got to take care. For gym cans, these are very good. They fold up and you can rock out and get your sets in.  For a SQ cans. No No NO  Btw there is no such thing as audible &#34;break in&#34;.  &#34;Break in&#34; is inaudible. Just your ears becoming trained to the sound.

"In past few months I've tried several products in order to solve wireless coverage problem. It's highly likely you are looking at this page and asking yourself: should I get this or maybe some other advertised antennas? Like this 9 dBi:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DMJI9TA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DMJI9TA&linkCode=as2&tag=codeproject-20&linkId=IOBXQKBKD3N2DRE3<br /><br />ASUS antenna is 5 dBi / 7 dBi... other product is 3 antennas with 9 dBi. Surely that's better? But other product has lower review rating, and most reviews are not detailed - one liners with - this works great, this doesn't work. What to do, oh what to do?<br /><br />Well, here is how you should decide:<br />1. You need to understand that this ASUS antenna is directional. Meaning, it'll work great in scenarios where you need to boost coverage in CERTAIN area. BUT, that certain area can't be behind like 3-4 walls. It also depends on what material was used for building walls we are talking about. This is why some people report that antenna is great, and some are having problems.<br /><br />2. Products like 9 dBi antenna that I've linked are good in scenarios where you need to boost existing coverage in ALL directions. However, considering layout of most houses, you are quite likely having trouble in one area - you wouldn't benefit from small increase of your existing wireless coverage. Meaning, if you already have signal in certain area, but it's 50% and you would want it to be 100% - it's quite likely those 9dBi antennas would help you.<br /><br />HOWEVER, what I found in practice is that for MOST people NEITHER antenna is good enough. The area where they want WiFi has like -70 dBi signal strenght and they want it to be -15 dBi. So, instead of spending $20+ on antenna, you should buy Wireless extender like NETGEAR EX6100 AC750:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00HHRP11C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=codeproject-20&linkId=VE2G4KUT5UZFBFOH<br /><br />Now, Wireless Extenders have a bad name because people don't understand a simple fact about them: they SPLIT the band. One half of traffic goes on communication to router and one half of traffic goes on communication to connected devices. HOWEVER, this is easily solvable, let me elaborate:<br /><br />1. Most important - you need QUALITY extender. This is why I linked NETGEAR EX6100 AC750. AC750 protocol (theoretically) supports speeds up to 750 MBit on both 2.4 & 5 GHz ranges. You have N150 extenders for $20 dollars, like NETGEAR WN1000RP N150 for example:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GGB342/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008GGB342&linkCode=as2&tag=codeproject-20&linkId=JOSRT4S44J4PBUNL<br /><br />But with extender like that you only have 2.4 GHz range. 150 Mbit is theoretical speed, so likely you are looking at 75 Mbit. That's split - so in the end it's highly likely that in BEST CASE SCENARIO you'll end up with 30 Mbit link on your connected device (~3MB/s).<br /><br />So, what you should do is buy REFURBISHED NETGEAR EX6100 AC750 for just $40. Devices like this are highly unlikely to malfunction - because of low heat generation and no mechanical parts. If they work within 90 days (refurbished guarantee period)... it's highly likely they'll work for years without problems.<br /><br />2. Now, when you have quality extender like EX6100, what you can do is use one band (5 GHz) to communicate with router and other band (2.4 GHz) to communicate with devices. Netgear calls this \\""FastLane Technology\\"" and you can use either band in this mode - if you have newer devices, use 2.4 GHz for router communication; this will probably allow you to place extender further away from router. And then, near extender, WiFi devices on 5 GHz will work great.<br /><br />3. Finally, EX6100 supports AP mode in which you connect it to router with LAN cable. If you don't mind the work that comes with laying out LAN cable, this mode will give you MAX possible speeds on both 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz. This is how professional WiFi networks are built. Whenever you need to expand WiFi coverage, you just connect more extenders with LAN cables, setup extender to clone SSID and WiFi password - job done.<br /><br />This is shaping up to be pretty lengthy review. So, instead of me keeping on with the babbling, let's stop here and if you have specific questions feel free to post comment. I'll try to come back with a good answer. And, if this review helped you, I would appreciate marking it as helpful. Good luck with increasing your WiFi coverage! ;)",positive

Forget it!<br /><br />Also, it requires a reset every ten minutes.<br />Resets require a paperclip.<br />When I am in the pool or a lake, where am I going to get a paperclip?<br /><br />This product is worthless.<br />Why did Sony even bother to manufacture it?<br />Why do they even stay in business?<br />If they shut down the company and fire all of their employees then nobody can sue them.",negative

"4/10/16- Update- Another bad HDMI port for the SC-82 and now I Iose sound and need to unplug the unit to get the sound back.  Removing another star.  Pioneer seems to be having HDMI port and power supply issues.  7/13/15 - Update - Looks like the HDMI on the SC-82 failed.  This is the second receiver that has failed for this HDMI port issue.  I had to move the HDMI from Cable/SAT to DVR to watch Comcast.  This receiver will be going back to Pioneer to see what they can do to repair this issue.  12/13/14- Update - Pioneer decided to upgrade my receiver to SC-82.  Wow, this is just amazing! If you can upgrade to the SC-82...Just do it!!! Unless you need Dolby Atmos...  [...]  Incredible sound!!  I would like to thank the persons at Pioneer for making my year! This baby has 4K, ESS SABRE Premier Audio DACs-Flac, Class D3 amplification(second to none), Elite quality!  I will continue to test this beast, and let you know in the SC-82 reviews.  It's good to know that Pioneer stands behind their products! I am increasing my rating from 2 stars to 4 for Pioneer's ability to win back my trust on their products and service.  I wish Pioneer would make a 4K/120hz 60\\"" HDTV.  Bring back the Kuro in 4K...please!  -----------------------------------------------------------------  I bought mine in Feb. 2014. It has been in the repair shop for about 2 months.  Bad HDMI card or bad main board still waiting.  I am very disappointed with Pioneer.  I have a Sony, Onkyo and even an old Pioneer 9300 that are working with no issues.  This receiver sounded great while it worked. I wish it had an 4K 120hz HDMI port.  I think it has a power supply or board issue. I see another review for this receiver with this issue.  I will let you know what Pioneer does to correct this issue.",negative
"It was fair, just didn't meet my expectations. I was only able to pickup one channel.",positive
Looks ok but i have some problems on Bluetooth music got cut everytime that i got my cel on my pocket wich is a pain just works when you have it in your hand not my kind of headphones,negative
"I received one from my brother as a gift. It took the first day of use to start stopping every few seconds. I downloaded an eBook in MP3 format- having to press play every 3 or 4 words is distracting. I deleted the book, then added old time radio programs- didn't even get through the first few sentences before it cut out again and again, then finally nothing. This is after being charged. I thought I was doing something wrong until I read other reviews. My brother's heart is in the right place. I'll buy another pair- this time better quality and pay more. Hope the company gets their product problems fixed.",negative
"Awesome, great purchase! All of the adapters work just fine! Thanks!",positive
Biggest disappointment was the fact that it is &#34;ONLY&#34; a step down in voltage ( input to output ).  I should read / understand these little circuits more thoroughly.  My mistake !,negative
OK but for some reason Pandora selections come through at very different volumes which continually need adjusting. This hadn't happened with previous speaker.,positive
"It's a good product and works as a true matrix very well. Every now and then it has issues with HDCP content and I have to restart it but it seems to work after that. If you leave it on without any active inputs it emits a high frequency buzzing sound. Once an input is turned on this sound goes away, but you definitely can't leave the unit on all the time as the noise is super loud.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this item. It works really well. Just the two problems listed above take away the one star. But for the price it can't be beat.",negative
"The speaker has a sleek design and it looks awesome. The biggest problem I have with it is that the bluetooth range is very low, so  it starts to break up once you take it more than 3 meters.",positive
"Seems to be something wrong with this adapter, not strong enough to power up my radio. My radio works great with batteries. Will just take it as a loss. Don't bother with this junk.",positive
Perfect fit for SANYO DP39843 TV. resovled the issue of not powering on.,positive
The cable is  very short. I can barely pull the phone while its connected to the Radio CD aux output in my car. It would have been a 5/5 product if the length was more generous.,negative
After about 6 months the Blue Tooth went out on the speaker rendering it useless.<br />I'm going to try and contact the company for replacement or repair. If they fix this I'll change my rating.,negative
I received the wrong chord!<br /><br />How do I return them?<br /><br />I revived one of them but not both of them,positive
"Don`t really get why people spend hundreds on earphones. These sorts of items get lost and broken all the time if even used in the slightest in appropriate way or subjected to the slightest humidity. These earphones are still working after over a year of use and abuse, with amazing sound quality at the same jaw-dropping low price. More often than not, earphones this cheap would have gone bust on one side or a loose cable connection by now. Nonething like that going on here. They`ve really exceeded my expectations.",positive
"The reason I bought these was because I really loved the sound quality from the Tracks I bought a while back. Great bass and clear sound. One day, my left speaker kind of had a shortage in it and made it hard to enjoy my music. Now, I bought the wireless ones thinking that would be better. I turn my music volume to the max and on the headphones and I don't get that much of bass like I want. The sound is decent. Not the best. For the price, I expected to get a better quality of sound from these Tracks Air. Maybe just maybe I might try Beats and see what hype is all about for those",positive
"The speaker itself is pretty good, nice and loud, however the LINE OUT feature sounds just a bit muffled to external speakers.  I was really looking forward to using this a lot with my better external speakers as a bluetooth receiver.  The option works, but does not sound quite as good as some other line out BT speakers I have used.",positive
"This worked very well and is attractive to have set out, instead of the basic black, speakers worked well.",positive
"Very good UPS.  Comes with USB cable and CyberPower software to monitor/manage one computer.<br />Software is very easy to configure (way better than APC) and the screen displays output, input and estimated run time. (Run times will change if you put the UPS under a load, so watch it carefully)",positive
good sound but they are very tight on my head. Ended up returning them for a more comfortable pair.,positive
"OK but has problems. It seems to block the calls effectively but the CID number does not show on my phone any more. When I first got it, the CID information showed, but suddenly It no longer shows. I don't like that.   Edit addition: It suddenly stopped working. It no longer blocked calls I selected to be blocked. Am fed up with this product and I am returning it.",negative
Didn't hold up to kids very well. But they did the job for a road trip,positive
"It works.  Arrived with an undamaged box, but one of the mounting brackets was bent.  I was able to straighten it with a couple pair of vise grips.  Simple to use.",positive
"Great sound, feel nice and comfortable in my ears. Only downside is that the cords tangle more than any other cords I've had. Just looking at them wrong seems to tie the two earbuds together.",positive
This is a pretty good portable cd player.  I really don't have use for the cassette deck anymore but the radio and the cd player work all right.  I would like to say more but its small and it didn't cost a lot so with that in mind its good.,positive
"I purchased a pair in November 2014. The wood detail and the woven nylon cable were big selling points for me, especially the nylon cable, since most earbud cables are made of flimsy plastic.<br /><br />When I first tried the headphones, I noticed that the natural EQ was a little on the muddy side for my tastes; too much mids and not enough treble. Bass is fine, punchy but not overpowering. The microphone is a great feature but it sits backwards on the left earbud and faces my shirt. My voice sounds muffled if I leave it like that, so I have to switch the left earbud into my right ear so that the mic faces outward; sound quality is clear once I do this.<br /><br />After about 7 months of moderate use, this pair is starting to go bad. A few days ago, I took my right earbud out with a normal, gentle tug and it came undone at the seam where the two pieces of wood meet the rubber seal. Luckily the wiring didn't detach and I was able to super glue the earbud back together.<br /><br />Overall, this pair lasted a good 7 months but is starting to show its true quality. This pair was $25 when I bought it but is now $40. There aren't many alternatives on the market with its features but at this price point I likely would not buy another pair.",positive
"Not crazy about putting screws into the side of decent speakers. I got some bungee cord and wrapped bungee cord around the speaker and bracket a couple of times, then tied it off. Speakers are secured (this is earthquake country) very well with the bungee cord. Used that way, the brackets are great. But it seems very off-kilter to think people will be willing to put screw holes in each side of their speakers to hold them to this bracket.",positive
I was very disappointed in the overall quality of this radio. It looks good on paper and in marketing material but was much cheaper in reality. This radio sounded like a good buy because of the options and features but fell far short in quality  and reception of signal. The unit could have also benefitted from a swiveling antenna to help it pull in signals without having to stick the radio outside or close to a window for basic reception. The hand crank has a cheap feel and feels like it will most likely break with moderate usage.  The plastic housing looks good but is also of the cheaper plastic type and could break easily if dropped.  Not what I had hoped for when making this purchase.,positive
"Epic fail all around with this device.  Very unhappy.  First, the ipod doc is not universal.  there is no way to use anything else but an iPod no newer iOS device.  We got past that issue and decided to try Bluetooth - the thing is not transmitting a Bluetooth signal; we tried every device in the house and it couldn't pickup a signal within 6' from the antenna.  The last flaw is the whine/hum that it emits when the volume is about 2db - this thing is loud so 2db was good listening volume to me. Whhhiinnnneee it went every few minutes.  Technically, its huge so measure your space, it's bright would you want it in a dark room, and there is no way to scroll the tuner unless you use the remote.  the prescan picked up all the wacky channels and those we wanted, we needed to find on the remote - hold button, and there didn't seem a way to change the order.",positive
Ok got for work cause I could only listen to one ear phone and they broke in a month . They did sound good,positive

"Item is good. Got a wrong color RED instead of ORANGE. Being a guy, it kinda gets embarassing :|",positive
Excellent device!!!  Easy to use with multiple adaptors.  Green light informs that there is voltage on the low side.  Used the device in multiple hotel rooms and any number of business settings.  Worked great!!,positive
Have these speakers installed in a covered 16' x 18' patio and they sound incredible!!! I would buy these speakers again and again..,negative
This works well...and especially like the built in volume control...Look around for deals...got one for $24.00 rather than the $39 price I see as new on other sites,negative
It works for flat screen TVs.  It's not that great if you are looking for a more theatrical sound.,positive
"it works when it works, i have to change one of these like every 6 months.",positive
It's okay not super awesome sound.  That tab broke off after a couple weeks use.  Customer service was almost nonexistent. They did respond to me and then ignored me?,positive
Went mono after 3 months - one month outside of the return date.  Never used with phone in my pocket and always kept in their bag.  Never folded the cable or anything.,negative
"This case is very nice; there is plenty of room for speaker, base, and charger. The base and charger store in top half, which is netting. Case is hard sided, vaguely resembling carbon fiber. This will keep everything together and protect of from dirt, scratching, etc., but it is not snug or foam in the case so if you drop it, it would likely get damaged.  so be careful, don't drop it and you'll be very satisfied with your purchase.",positive
"They're worth a shot just because of the price, but my hope for these was that I would be able to use these while working out or going for a run. The volume control is too big, which causes the right ear bud to be pulled out of the ear when running. For the price, I'll just keep them and use them around the house.",negative
Mine was DOA.  Refused to power on right out of the box.  Confirmed it was this surge protector after unplugging everything and plugging it back into my old surge protector on the same wall outlet.  Disappointed in Belkin and I am hesitant to buy another product of theirs.  However I gave it an extra star because it appears to be a great design and I can't find anything else like it out there so at least they are innovative with their products.,negative
Product as described.  Boxed and good packaging for the component.,positive
"Really pleased with the ear cups. Has totally change all aspects of the headphones. For me, there has been an improvement in the upper frequencies, but most dramatically has really opened up the soundstage. Sounds totally different to what I had before. Comfort has also improved, now I can hardly feel them when on. And at a price much less than genuine replacement cups, these items are probably one of the cheapest ways to improve the performance of your headphones. Love em.",positive
I like this case. I am always tossing the speaker in my gym bag and I don't have to worry about ruining the speaker. Great hard case!,positive
needs to be in a window to make it work at its potential.,negative
a lot of damages and very fragile. i would not buy it again,positive
Mine quit charging after about 1 years use. You know this is a problem with these and all things that you have to charge with the little mini Android Charge. Too lake to send it back.. This should be a lesson to any one who buys a $200 Bluetooth speaker. Don't feel all that back chucking a $19 speaker..,negative
Don't waste your money! It sounded and worked great the first four times I used. However the CD cover latch broke the fifth time. I am unable to close the CD door so the music won't play unless I lay it flat and put a book on it to keen the CD door closed.,positive
"This 3 in 1 Version 1.4 HDMI Male to Male Cable with Micro and Mini HDMI Adapters couldn't have come at a better time. We recently got a mini projector and needed an HDMI cable for it to connect from the projector to our extra Roku. The cable feels very well-made and the adapters feel like they are pretty secure when added onto the cable. It's a good length cable at 5 feet so there's plenty of room to play with.<br /><br />When we tried it out, as mentioned earlier, we used it with our mini projector that we recently purchased. It was easy to connect both projector and Roku to the cable. Our Roku is set at 1080p and the projector was able to project the image at 1080p onto the wall. The image produced was clear and surpassed our expectations. We moved the cables around a little while running it to be sure they stayed secure and stayed in place and there were no interruptions which, to me, indicates it's a good cable. The adapters are a great addition to this cable since many different devices use different methods of connecting. Because we now have them on hand, we know we will be prepared if needed. This cable can also be used for many other things, such as, game consoles, computers, and other electronics. Overall, I'm very happy we got this HDMI cable. It has worked out perfectly for our needs and we plan to make this our go-to HDMI cable now that we will be using our projector often.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount so that I may test it out and write an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.",positive
Replaces an older turntable.  I like the sound of LPs and am enjoying the ability to play them again!,negative
"I was disappointed with these headphone at first. The ear cups are not as large as my Audio-Technica wired headphones. At first, these headphone didn't seem to offer a lot of bass but after using them several times, the bass response is much better. The ear cups don't fit completely around my ears so they don't block out all of the outside noise. The sound is acceptable and the Bluetooth connection is great. The on speaker controls are a big bonus over wired headphone. They are a good option when you don't want to be tied down with a cord.",negative
"Both wires have a Mike , the black one the mice is very cheap though housing is already cracked, and neither have volume control",positive
"This gives up more channels, so I cant complain there. I don't think this exists but I would like a wireless antenna. I have these cords under my carpet going across my living room. Kinda an eye soar.",negative
had to throw some of them away.  They arrived broken!,negative
Except for the fact that it needs quite a bit of power to drive on 10m-40m it works fine,negative
The leather wraps are well made and of real leather.<br />They are a little larger than I expected to contain the many cables I carry for charging my pocket electronics.,positive
"Was not  Element remote. Instead, was some other universal remote.",negative
"The sound is unbelievable. I downloaded bass boost to my smartphone as that seems to compliment them well. I listen to music for over 7 hours as well as taking phone calls. They fit into the ear and cancel out background noise great. They also pair easily although the range is average.  It takes voice commands and has some other features. The only drawback is the alerts are given in broken english with a voice that has a Asian dialect. It didn't bother me, but could aggravate some. It charges in about 45 minutes to an hour which is good. For the price and the overall quality, I recommend them.",positive
"The sound quality is great for the second or two that you don't hear any static. I am 2 feet from the transmitter and I hear static, and if I turn my head to the side, it pops and the static intensifies. These are not worth the money at all. I expected static from a distance or when I left the room, but not when I am 2 feet from the transmitter.",positive
"This product works, but I would not say it works effectively.  It IS an antennae, and you do get channels, but we did not get as many as our next door neighbor does.  With that said, you should know that we  live in a two story house in the woods, we  had the antennae pointing east in a window from the first floor, and the channels it was able to pull in work OK, but flickered a lot, even after we did the channel scan.  Our neighbor uses an attic antenna. So our situation is particular. I think our next investment may be with antenna for in the attic. This may work fine in a high story apartment building... (we had the 50 mile range one).  It may work fine if you watch very little TV, and just want news or something.  We are looking for a cable replacement so we need to dig deeper than what this antenna has to offer. I am giving it two stars because I want people to read this and understand their set up before buying it, and if you live like we do, it may not work, and save your money.",positive
Came with multiple scratches and has a permanent fog on the lens that gets annoying after about 7 seconds,positive
I experienced the syncing issues. Was able to return without hassles.,positive
Sound quality pretty good but headset cuts off for no reason periodically. After a couple months left side went out. Better off spending a little more and getting a better quantity unit,positive
"No Bass, tinny sound. Clicks in and out when connected. After one day the left ear piece stopped working and literally fell off the wire. I cant say i hated it so i wont give a 1 star, but it is poorly made.  Misleading marking it at $99.00 on amazon and giving a  &#34;deep discount lightning deal&#34; to bring it down to $22 to trick me into thinking it could stand up with the other $100 wifi headphones on the market.  this is indeed a $20 pair of headphones being sold at exactly that. Buyer beware.",negative
The fit is terrible for anyone without large ears. Nobody I know was comfortable with them on.,negative
Wasn't really what I expected it to be with size but sounds decent the 4in sub on it isn't that great at all.,positive

"And now for this product's first REAL review. I received my speaker today in the mail. I'd like to start off by saying the speaker pictured shows a branded speaker. This speaker is in no way branded, not even a cheap knock off brand. It is a CHEAP Chinese piece of junk. The mounting hardware is too small to fit standard handlebars. The screw on the mounting hardware was stripped right out of the box, so even if it had fit it wouldn't have worked. Also the knob for the screw itself is just a piece of plastic fitted loosely onto the other end of the screw which is not threaded, so even if you wanted to tighten it you couldn't it would just spin the knob and not the screw. Now for the speaker itself. Again right out of the box I paired this speaker to my iPhone 5s with no problem. The problem came when I tried to use it. The speaker sounds blown and very scratchy. Even when no music is playing about every 10 seconds or so it sounds like the speaker pops. Overall this is maybe the worst Amazon purchase I have ever made. Happy to say I already have a refund coming my way.<br /><br />I am lead to believe that the previous reviews for this product are fake, they have to be. I say this because the mount doesn't properly fit standard handlebars!! They might fit a child's handlebars. This seller cannot be trusted. I say that because if they can't even send you what is pictured then in my book they are dishonest and should be avoided.",negative
"Works well, haven't had any problems.  Nice to have digital display but would be good to have clock at the same time (you only see time if you turn it off).  Totally looks like a baby monitor.",positive
Seems to work fine.  Can carry it from place to place.  good speaker system.,positive
"I've owned it 3 years and was used very little. now that I want to use it, it won't work properly. won't ever buy again. it has frozen up on the recording side (by not separating recordings). I had a J3 8gb and it did the same thing.",negative
Earphones are pretty good... They work how they are supposed to fit well no problems yet....I'll have to see how long they last,negative
"Works well enough at a desk or night stand, but sound gets distorted if you turn the sound up too high. The instructions were a little confusing, but I was able to pair it with my LG 4 phone with no problems.",negative
"I thought I was getting a good deal... but I guess i can't complain for only $14. If I walk about 4 feet away from my phone, they start to skip if there's not clear line of sight, as in there's something....

I'm not mad about the quality... it wast just 14$.... im just mad I bought 2",positive
"Picked these up for Sonos 1's. They were really easy to install using the provided mounting supplies into my apartment's plaster walls (I used a 1/4 drill bit for the pilot hole). It juts out a little from the wall and is not completely flush, but for the price, it's a great set.",positive
"I use AA batteries exclusively on my Garmin GPS (Oregon series), it works from 2x AA batteries. I expected much better performance from Centura batteries. They kinda failed. I charged them 4 days before we went on a 5-day backpacking hike. Each set of 2 Centura batteries lasted just one day of a normal GPS use. For comparison, my 2-years old AccuPower AccuLoop (2300mAh LSD NiMH batteries) lasted 2+ days (close to 2.5 days). I'm not sure why Centura worked twice shorter. It's possible that their voltage drops a bit lower (compare to AccuLoop) during discharge, and this triggers &#34;Low Batteries&#34; power-down of my Garmin GPS (even though, these batteries may have some usable charge left). I don't have any other devices where I can test them, and were they may show better performance. As I said, Garmin GPS is the only device where I use AA batteries (hence the title of my review), and it drains Centuras really fast. 09/01/2015 update: I hoped after one-two full charge/discharge cycles these Centuras would work better. Well, they became even worse. Now they work less then half-day in my GPS. What a waste! stay away from this garbage.",positive
"This product was just *okay* for most of the time I owned it, but recently, after about a year the cable has begun to short. Now I have to get up to even see if its registering button presses, and adjust it if it isn't. The range is also pretty bad.",negative

"I was quite disappointed by these earphone tips.  Here's why:<br /><br />Extremely poor fit on my Jaybird Bluebuds X.  I watched the video multiple times to see exactly how to get the tips onto the earbuds, and not only does it take an uncomfortably large amount of pressure to force these onto my expensive headphones, they never sat straight on the posts.  It doesn't make sense to advertise that these are compatible with these specific headphones and then force me to modify them to work.<br /><br />The build quality leaves a lot to be desired.  As I mentioned before, they take a large amount of pressure to seat onto the posts of my headphones.  Well, luckily I tried putting the wrong size on first as the foam ripped off of the plastic interior portion.  For such a niche product that is supposed to elevate my listening experience, and charging ~$4 a piece for these, I was very let down.<br /><br />They don't stay put during any kind of workout that causes you to sweat.  After all of the above drama, I get continually frustrated during my workouts to have to re-insert my earbuds multiple times.  I'm not doing any exercises that are putting any strain on the cord of my earbuds, but almost instantly after beginning a rep, the sound quality diminishes to a very low level.  With normal tips you would just have to cram them back in, but with these you still have to compress them and then wait for them to re-expand once in your ears.  Not how I want to be spending my time in the gym.<br /><br />tl;dr - Frustrating to add to earbuds, disappointing quality, and even more frustrating in actual use.  Stay away if you are buying these for Jaybird Bluebuds X.",negative
"Fit perfectly, delivered quickly, lens cracked after 2 months.",positive

"Superior sound excellence, flexibility, and feature usability. Pairs perfectly with high impedance ER-4S IEM and Sennheiser HD-800.<br /><br />If you are already happy with the apparent volume and sound quality of your current listening experience, a headphone amp (with built-in DAC) such as the PHA-3  is not likely to benefit you.  The basic reason for purchasing a headphone amplifier is that most portable devices have trouble driving expensive headphones.  There are two effects: the volume is too low, and the sound quality suffers.  For most listeners, the soundstage isn't as clear and the music seems &#34;dull.&#34;  When a headphone amplifier is used, the headphones seem to &#34;wake up&#34; and volume is normal.<br /><br />However, if you have high quality headphones or in-ear-monitors and value portability (convenient use on travel, or at home around the house), then you should strongly consider the PHA3.  There are many fine headphone amplifiers with an integrated DAC, but the PHA-3 is surely one of the best and likely unmatched in flexibility and user features.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with the PHA-3 and highly recommend it for single ended use with the Etymotic ER-4S In-Ear-Monitor (IEM) and I especially recommend pairing it in the balanced mode with the Sennheiser HD-800 headphones - which sound absolutely fantastic on this amp in this configuration.  I still use the ER-4S IEM for exercise, airplane flights, and business travel, but I mostly live with the HD-800's connected in balanced mode with the PHA-3 when I'm relaxing to music or writing.<br /><br />PHA-3 Critical Feature Summary:<br />1) Single ended output for regular devices (100mW per channel into 32 Ohms) and balanced (differential) output (320 mW/per channel into 32 Ohms) for specially cabled headphones.  I found that for 100 Ohm devices the single ended power sounds wonderful and has plenty of volume.<br /><br />For the HD-800 (300-600 Ohms), single ended power sounded very good and volume was fine for my tastes, but after listening to the higher power balanced output, I strongly prefer it, even if I do not listen at anywhere near maximum volume which I would find painful.<br /><br />Balanced output provides a theoretical 4x (6dB) - Sony shows a 3.2x or 5 dB - increase in the power per channel versus single ended and provides more than enough volume and slew rate performance for high impedance (300-600 Ohm) headphones like the HD800.  The HD-800 sound absolutely fantastic when driven in this configuration.  This critical feature takes quite a bit of explanation. The key point is that you need the right cable to access this feature.  More detail on balanced operation is provided at the end of this review.<br /><br />2) Internal battery - sufficient but you will often operate with the device plugged in and charging while you are listening<br />-- this is direct experience.  At the power levels I use while listening, the unit does in fact charge while I am listening.<br />-- note: in balanced mode, (which I recommend), the power available is 4x the power from single ended mode, so sizing an internal  battery for extended playback is difficult, no matter how &#34;efficient&#34; the amplifier is... Given that limitation, Sony's compromise between battery size and convenience seems perfect to me. (Note: balanced mode doubles the voltage going to the headphones.  Doubling voltage, yields a 4x power increase at &#34;high volumes&#34; over single-ended mode, or in this case battery consumption, because power scales with the square of the voltage).<br /><br />3) small size (about twice as thick as  a smart phone and similar in length and width) in a very convenient and attractive form factor.  The design of the unit provides audio cord connection protection because the cord jacks are &#34;recessed&#34; behind the volume knob and a projecting metal flange.  Supplied silicone bands are perfect for attaching phone devices or mp3 players.<br /><br />4) accepts digital inputs from all Apple devices, Windows, Android, Linux, etc.<br />-- Sony licensed from Apple the iOS direct digital interface, so the PHA-3 supports any combination of digital inputs from all Apple iOS devices and the older iPods. I frequently use the PHA-3 with a 160GB iPod Classic when I'm outside.<br />-- Sony uses a standard micro-USB connector for all Android phones, tablets, Windows, Linux, MacOS, laptops, desktops, and music servers.<br /><br />5) very high standard of digital data format flexibility and analog sound reproduction ... read detailed reviews online if these items are a critical factor in selecting the PHA-3 over other competitors.  The sound quality and dynamic range (no-hiss) is stunningly beautiful on the HD-800 and the PHA-3 easily accepts all the most common music data formats.  In my case I use Apple products (MacBook Pro Retina, iPod, iPhone, Apple TV Music Server) to manage my music files and all of the various file formats,  encoding bit rates, and sample rates in my collection have worked perfectly for me.  If you are a DSD or FLAC music format enthusiast,  Sony provides a music player that runs on your laptop for DSD files, and there are many laptop players for FLAC.  Also, although it takes extra disk space, you can use a lossless converter to store a FLAC file into an iTunes/Apple format.<br /><br />6) Sony has a feature called DSEE HX to improve the sound quality of many digital formats... other reviewers have found this helpful but I find it hard to discern the benefit, so this is not a critical feature to me.<br /><br />7) Cables: The PHA-3 needs at least two micro USB plug to USB Type A cables (one is provided): one for charging while listening, and the other for connecting to your laptop for digital output.  I found that a 6 inch 30 pin Apple iPod to USB  Type A &#34;synch&#34; cable (not just charging cable) was perfect to connect an iPod Classic.  Over time,  I purchased another 2 micro USB to USB Type A cables to leave around some fixed charging locations.  4 foot flat cables pack nicely into a carry bag.<br /><br />Additional Notes:<br />AN1) headphone impedance:<br />The higher the impedance of a headphone, the harder it is to drive (it takes more voltage to send the same amount of current).  Typical earbuds are about 16 Ohms, high quality in-ear-monitors are often 30 to 100 Ohms, and many high quality headphones are 100 to 600 Ohms.  There are interesting engineering reasons for this, but basically it is easier to make a better motor with a higher impedance.  There is a very nice discussion of this on http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/02/headphone-impedance-explained.html<br /><br />AN2) Drive strength and Pairing:<br />The PHA-3 was designed to pair with the Sony MDR-Z7 headphones.  Those headphones are 70 Ohms at 1 KHz (mid range).  The PHA-3 pairs extremely well with the Etymotic ER-4S (100 Ohm) and also pairs extremely well with the Sennheiser HD-800  (300-600 Ohms) using a balanced cable. It also pairs acceptably well with the HD-800 (lower maximum volume) using single-ended operation, but most audiophiles will want to purchase or make a balanced cable.  It is always hard to know, but to my ears, the balanced cable and differential drive of the PHA-3 make the Sennheiser HD-800 really sing.  I purchased my balanced cable from customcans.co.uk.  I normally listen to the PHA-3 from a MacBook Pro or an iPod Classic so customcans &#34;default&#34; 1.5 meter size was perfect for me.<br /><br />AN3) More discussion on balanced outputs and balanced cables for the PHA-3<br />A balanced cable using the Sennheiser connectors and the 3.5mm TRS jacks the PHA-3 requires is easy to make or purchase.  I bought a very high quality one from customcans.co.uk.  They will also make a balanced cable for any headphone to your specifications.  It takes about 1 week for them to ship your order.  Note: although I personally do not use a Pono player, the Pono player also uses two 3.5mm TRS jacks for balanced (or differential) output, so any cable that will connect your headphones to a Pono player will also connect to the PHA-3.<br /><br />Balanced output is an incredibly nice feature for this price range and yet Sony has also managed to make this conveniently portable.  If you are using the Sony MDR-Z7 headphones,  Sony provides the appropriate cable with their headphones and there is nothing else to do.  If you want to pair the PHA-3 with the Sennheiser HD-800's or another high quality headphone it will take only a little extra effort, but it is well worth it.  This feature really influenced me when I made the decision to purchase the PHA-3.<br /><br />All high quality headphones can be cabled for  balanced (or differential) output, however the reason it takes a little extra effort - or an additional cable purchase - is because balanced drive is not a headphone industry standard and companies offer various solutions.  For example, Sony (and apparently Pono) chose standard 3.5mm jack cables to keep their product small over the large XLR cables in common use in microphones, audio mixing equipment, and some keyboards (my old Roland RD700 has XLR).  A good discussion of balanced cabling and some of the advantages is located at http://www.headphone.com/pages/balanced-headphones-guide.  If your headphones use connectors on each driver (like the Sennheiser HD800, HD600, HD650, all Audeze, and HiFiMAN planar-magnetic headphones) it is very simple to make or have made a balanced cable (see the end of this review for basic advice).<br /><br />AN4) Why is balanced operation important?<br />To achieve the same sound quality, a differential amplifier system is substantially easier and less costly for a manufacturer to design and package into a tiny,  5 volt or less (4.7V Lithium-ion) USB style battery subsystem, than one single amplifier.  The net result is that the PHA-3 has 4 amplifiers ( 2 for each channel), each running on 5 volts or less, instead of 2 &#34;bigger&#34;  amplifiers running at 10 volts or less.<br /><br />In balanced mode, the signals swing differentially, effectively doubling the voltage delivered to the headphone.  Hence, from the same USB style battery subsystem, the power available to drive the headphones is nominally 4x (6dB) the power from single ended mode.  This results in more than sufficient volume and slew rate for high impedance headphones like the HD-800.  In differential mode, two amplifiers are used instead of one to &#34;split the effort&#34; to drive each of the headphone channels (left or right).  The positive and negative leads from each (left or right channel) headphone driver coil are independently driven by a separate amplifier.  Using two amplifiers per channel doubles the amount of voltage that can be delivered to the headphone driver using the same battery power system.  Doubling voltage, yields a 4x power increase because power scales with the square of the voltage.<br /><br />AN5) Note on modifying your own headphones:<br />If your headphones are hard wired, you can modify the cable directly and solder it to your own connectors (like 3.5mm sockets) to make it simple to build a replacement cables for single ended or balanced use.  In a 3.5mm TRS jack, the Tip is the &#34;+&#34; terminal, the Ring is the &#34;-&#34; terminal, and the Sleeve is connected to the electrical shield (often a &#34;braid&#34;) around the two wires inside the cable.  Headset coils or transducers are symmetric devices, so labeling one side &#34;+&#34; and the other &#34;-&#34; is only important to keep the phases correct.  If you make your own cable or connector, it's easy to use an ohm-meter to find out which wire is &#34;+&#34; and which wire is &#34;-.&#34;  If the wires are color coded, it's very simple.  If not, then as you cut each wire, carefully label each end (4 labels) with a piece of tape.  Now use the ohm meter to find which wires are connected to the Sleeve of the TRS jack (probably 1/4 inch) on the cable you just cut. These wires are the &#34;-&#34; leads and need to be ultimately connected to a 3.5mm &#34;Ring&#34; when you are done with your cable.  The other wires are the &#34;+&#34; wires and will ultimately connect to the &#34;Tip&#34; of the 3.5mm jack.r balanced (or differential) output, so any cable that will connect your headphones to a Pono player will also connect to the PHA-3.<br /><br />Balanced output is an incredibly nice feature for this price range and yet Sony has also managed to make this conveniently portable.

"Yes, it works delivering the optical connection, and the plugs work as expected, however, I would not have bought it if I saw the picture I took attached to this review.<br /><br />Could some people actually prefer this very, very thin cable to the regular cables?  Well, not me.<br /><br />I was amazed they could even MAKE a TOSLink cable this thin.<br /><br />I could easily see it getting bent over sandwiched between components or during moving, which would then damage the fiber optic core.",negative
I haven't even plugged it in yet and am already unsatisfied because there are scuffs all over the front.,negative
Nice enhancement to the S6 Active.  The case is made out of a rubbery plastic and tightly fits the unit.  It adds a small bevel to the front so one can lay down the device face down without scratching the face.  It aids in gripping the phone.  The corners are where the phone would most likely hit when dropped and this provides some squishy material to reduce the chance of a dent or scratch.  I like it.,positive

"I purchased the Liger Ultra-Thin Indoor Antenna with a 35 Mile Range from Amazon on June 29, 2015.  It was delivered on July 1, 2015.  Before I ordered the antenna, I checked with antennaweb.org and found that my home is less than 3 miles from one set of broadcast antennas with 9 stations and 6 miles from the other set with 6 stations.  I can actually see the closer antennas as they are on a large hill in front of my home.  To my surprise, after connecting the antenna to the TV, I found I could only receive 6 stations and none of the pictures were close to high definition.  I tried moving the antenna to a number of locations, most of which were actually in the direct line of sight through a window to the antennas in front of my home, but the results were the same at all of the locations.  I understand that the location might cause an issue with the more distant antennas because of small mountains between my home and the antenna site but I would expect excellent reception for the antennas that are in direct line of sight and only 3 miles away.",positive
"This would be a good inexpensive set of jumpers except for the following:<br />1) The wire posts have burrs that must be filed before use in a protoboard. I destroyed a number of contact holes in my EIC-106 protoboard before realizing what was going on. Brushing both ends of each jumper across a flat file removed the burrs.<br />2) Over a half dozen of the short orange jumpers were defective. Don't know why only orange colored wire was affected but it was driving me nuts because the prototyped circuits didn't work until I tested every jumper I used and tossed out the defective ones.<br />So before using any jumper, you may want to test the continuity of each jumper first, and if it passes then file off the burrs.",positive

"Edit: I have amended the review to reflect receiving a new D1. I will leave part of the previous review in case anyone else experiences static and/or pops  The D1 is sturdy, relatively light, and makes a notable difference when used in place of even the best on board DACs, at least on Windows and Linuux machines. I use it primarily for editing interviews and listening to music and it serves admirably for both. I have used it with Beyerdynamic 990 pro 250 headphones, Audiotechnica ATH M30s, and powered monitor and the sound quality is excellent through all. Interviews and talking heads are clear, no background noise at all (aside from noise introduced by clients who assume HVAC noise will just magically not be heard behind their mumbling). I listen to an eclectic mix of music; all genres sound good, with a cappella, classic, jazz and acoustic pop/rock offering new layers I had not previously experienced. Metal and rap do not have the over amplified, distorted bass that purchasers of Beats seem to like, but I suppose you could hook Beats up to it and still enjoy the perfectly delivered signal, much like a dog would eat chateaubriand but is content to lick it's own ass.   ORIGINAL (edited): I do not usually write reviews for products that seem to be faulty.  The product seems sturdy, the construction is fine, it is aesthetically non-offensive, has the inputs and outputs I need/want and might be a good DAC/Amp, if it worked properly. The sound, minus the occasional static pop, is fine. The amp is too weak to effectively power Beyerdynamic 990 pro-250s, or rather, the cans are about a quarter of the volume of speakers run through the same amp. And the D1 I received, as other reviews have noted, would randomly generate bursts of static. So possibly a lemon, I thought, although with devices hooked up to a computer there are other possibilities. So I explored all the possibilities in hardware and software, swapped the D1 into a stereo system, tried it on other computers, redid all the software setting for bit rate and depth. The static is not just an inconvenience, though it is one when editing video/audio file: I am fairly sure the static blew out a pair of Mackie monitors.  As I am not sure what other reviewers were running as a source, I will note I was running the D1 on a Windows 8 then a Windows 10 system. Both OSes demonstrated the static. The main machine has an Asus motherboard, though several of the other test machines did not.",negative

Juggle it even a tiny bit while in any jack and you'll hear static or other artifacts. Have the jack facing up while device is in you me pocket?

"Ultimately traded these for RB-61 II's.  They are clean and crisp, but aren't quite as full as the larger bookshelf.  If you are space constrained, you'll like these.  If you've got the room, you'll love the 61.  Can't go wrong either way.",positive
"Impressed at first, bought it for my music only, bought it to play to my Bose speaker, worked great for a minute then, i added more music, and decided to put in a mini-sd card, shot, locked up, just says &#34;MediaLib update&#34; but it's just frozen, save your money, buy something american made, if one exists!!",positive

This is not the FTDI chip for the USB communications. It should be identified as such. It is not a fully compatible Arduino Nano as it does not have the FTDI chip and needs special drivers to be obtained. The seller should also let the buyer know where to get the special drivers for the USB communication chip which is a chinese chip. It does work but beware of the differences. For the advanced user it should be ok.,negative
You lose about 30% of power when you run your speakers through this. Feels really cheaply made.,positive
"It didn’t take long for me to fall in love with this bluetooth speaker. I pretty much won me over with the sound quality, but the ease of use, battery life, and compact size sealed the deal. If you’re looking for a waterproof or rugged speaker this isn’t it, but all the other features paired with the sound quality make it worth it to me. My only real complaint is that I wish it came with a better fabric bag to store it in, but that’s getting picky. Check out the complete review on TechSpective.net: http://techspective.net/2015/08/25/review-nixeus-arc-4-0-bluetooth-speaker/",positive
Its not new ! Its a refurbished! ! Theirs a two chips in the corner.,negative
Works great...when it connects to your device. It will connect to my phone but everyone else who tries to connect to the speaker can't connect! That's really annoying but it does sound good when it works.,positive
Issues right out of the box. Not built well. Would cut in and out during any physical activity where the cord was moving around too much.,positive
"For $30 these headphones are fantastic. They conformable cover my big ears and sound is great. I really don't notice any difference between them and my $200 beats by dre, except these sound more full.  My only complaint is that the cord is ridiculously long. I am 6'1&#34; and when I stood up with the headphones on and my phone in my pocket, the cord drug on the floor. Plus I can't replace the cord since it's part of the headphone.  Other than that it's great.",positive
These batteries DO NOT FIT inside UPS units with which they are advertised to be compatible. The batteries I received were a couple of millimeters taller than the originals supplied with the original UPS units and were too large to fit in the battery chamber inside the UPS units.,negative
Have to put a nickel in the arm to keep it from skipping. Old trick. Inconvenient and kinda ugly but it works.,negative
"I am on the verge of giving this 4 or even 5 stars, but i will wait and edit this review after a while.  The fit is great.  I have worn these on a couple of hot sweaty runs and gym workouts.  I had the Jlab Go previously, and I don't think it could handle the amount of sweat clumsy button pushing. But like the Jlab Go, it stays in place very well. To it's credit, it didn't take as much manual manipulation to get it to fit me...or at least not nearly as much as the Jlab Go.  If I reviewed just on fit and integrity, this would get 4 stars.<br /><br />I was really hoping for a crisp clear sound with smooth bass.  It's almost there.  It is not as crisp or clear as the default Apple brand ear buds or the Jlab Go, but at least better than the JarvN motion BT headset, or the wired JVC ear buds I had before.  I played with the iPhone equalizer a bit and that helped a little.  Her is what gets me though. I played some of my old school Rock and Hip hop and it was ok.  I played some of my daughter's Kelly Clarkson, and it sounds better.  So maybe with better recorded music and a 3rd party equalizer app through an iPhone this will get a 4 or a 5.  Still the toughness and fit make it at least worth the money",positive
It's a wonderful headphone. I didn't tried bose headphones but I think it is better than Dr beats .,positive

"These gloves have no type of &#34;fit&#34; to them. In fact, they actually hindered any jobs I tried work on, creating safety issues.  I couldn't manipulate my fingers enough to accomplish the simplest of tasks.  The rubber is thick, and appears to be durable, but the fit of the gloves was so awkward, it rendered them useless.  I would not recommend these gloves for any type of work, including electrical work that they are made for.",positive
Loved them for the first three months I had them then they died. Ear cushions are comfortable but get hot.,positive
Only used two or three times before it stopped holding a charge. Can't get it to turn on even when plugged in. Disappointed.,negative
"This thing lasted a few international trips until one day the green plastic inside broke. This was from normal usage but it was disappointing that the plug lasted for such a short amount of time. I tried to see if I could open it up to remove the green plastic covers, but I was unable to. The availability of the 2 USB plugs was an added bonus to this charger, but if the socket doesn't work, it makes no sense for me to carrying this big thing around for just USB plugs.",positive
I have 4 pairs of Cooltree. I prefer these over my Bose!! Comfortable for even those of us with small heads and use them for running.,positive
Fast shipping and product was just as described!  Thanks.,positive

"First unit had huge bluetooth issues and randomly shut off in the middle of watching something. The second unit randomly dips the volume, and has the same intermittent bluetooth issues.<br /><br />It's hard to explain the volume issue but let me try. Say the volume goes from 1 to 100. We will have it set to 60 and randomly it appears to go down to 10 and then a few minutes later comes back up. Touching the volume up or down does not seem to change it. It's sort of like it has a mind of it's own.<br /><br />Sound wise it is bass heavy. That is nice for video games, less for movies and more so with my second complaint. There is no real center channel so therefore the bass heavy system makes it, at times, impossible to hear the vocal track on any movie. I guess I would describe it as 'boomy'. Other reviews have talked about this, too.<br /><br />Just for sanity, I love Polk. I have a full 5.1 stereo with Polk towers in the front, back and center. I love that system and I know not to expect that kind of quality with a soundbar but unfortunately this unit doesn't even live up to it's written expectations.",positive
"These are reasonably easy to use, offer good overall sound quality, and do a good job of canceling outside noise. But the Bluetooth connection drops out frequently, even with my phone in my pocket or next to me. In addition, the headphones fit very tightly across my head/over my ears. I wear glasses, so it gets physically painful to wear the headphones for long. I can't really recommend them.",positive
At first this speaker sounded great.. 4 or 5 weeks later the speaker has blown. It's crackly and sounds like crap. I would not recommend this speaker..,positive
Cheap and flimsy.  Broke after less than a week of use.  You really do get what you pay for.,negative
I got this today.  I was so excited when I hooked it up and had a crystal clear picture.  I was less excited when I realized I get a few seconds of great feed and then about 30 seconds of nothing but pixels like it is buffering and can't keep up with the feed. Anybody else have this problem?  I'm trying to decide whether or not to send it back.,negative
"Fit and comfort are every bit as good or better than the white triple flange version from Shure. I found that the silicone used for these was just as soft, and provided just a good a seal as the more expensive Shures.  The Shure triples, at least for me, always needed to be trimmed down to a double flange, but these were a perfect fit right out of the box with no alterations needed. And where the white Shures look dingy after just a short while (even after washing), the black silicone used on these continue look great.  Combine that with the price that's a fraction of the Shures, and it's a no brainer.",positive

It's pretty good for the price and sometimes easy to in tangle if it's not too bad,negative

"I purchased these headphones after reading a number of positive reviews. However, for me, these headphones were very tight fitting, did not pair (bluetooth) at all with my IPhone, and even after connecting my IPhone using the hard wire, the sound was very scratchy.  OK, OK... When I'm wrong, I'm man enough to admit it. After posting the above review, a representative from BOHM contacted me, offering me a complimentary pair of the same headphones. I respectfully declined the offer stating that a complimentary pair wouldn't change anything, and that I needed headphones that paired with my IPhone, didn't sound scratchy, and made my head feel like it was in a vise. The rep. indicated that a few design changes had been made since my original purchase and that they would be willing to send me the new and improved pair gratis. WELL....... how could I argue with that? So a new pair was shipped with in 48 hours. AND damn if they didn't work as advertised!!!  Everything works great,,,, the pairing works beautifully, noise cancelling works ok, sounds is very nice, true bass and treble comes through beautifully.... can't ask for anything more... except they still fit rather tightly, but that could be because of my big head..... :-)  Now people.... I don't run into this very often, a company that actually proactively sought out to make things right.... wow... now that is customer service we should be seeing more of.... kudos to BOHM.... well done...",positive
I bought this a few weeks back and it worked great.. Until the mike button stopped working and one of the earpieces started to malfunction.. Now I am having to toggle it in the port to make it work and hold it certain angles.. The mike and the button stopped working completely..<br /><br />These started off as a great pair but the construction seems to be really poor and doesnt last at all..,positive
Own one already for older tv with no remote (tv runs off cable remote).  Needed another for my mothers DVD/VCR she's also has no remote for hers.  Hard to find locally.,positive
"This was advertised to fit a Compaq 2200. It did not. It is not worth the time, energy, or money to send it back. Do not order!",positive
Beware don't put it on full volume if your listening to anything that has any kind of bass. I used the speaker for probably 2 weeks listening to podcasts then I turned on some music and it blew the speaker out. Bluetooth connects well but you can't go around walls it starts cutting out. Did sound good while it lasted though.,positive
Amazing for the price.<br />But then again for the Price.<br /><br />The sound is not clear enough<br />The bass is light<br /><br />But i cannot complain<br />It is compact and very good to pack with.<br />Bluetooth is all about portability.<br /><br />So it is very good with budget.,positive
"[[VIDEOID:e229a5a9e33f48a2bdcda00e41f34db7]]Included with the headset are the instructions, a micro USB charging cable (approximately 30 inches in length), 2 ear anchors, a carry case, a Velcro cable strap holder, a set of Comply ear cushions and three pairs of silicone ear cushions (S/M/L).<br /><br />Having been familiar with Brainwavz wired headsets; I was interested in trying their first attempt with making a Bluetooth headset.  This headset has a lot to live up to as most of Brainwavz' wired sets have had a lot going for them in sound, quality and comfort.<br /><br />As with most of their headsets, Brainwavz provides a lot of accessories including my favorite ear tips for comfort, the Comply ear tips.  The Bluetooth set is a flat cable design with s 3 three button control about 4 inches from the right ear piece.  The control piece has the multi-function button (power/answer/hang-up/play/pause) and the volume/next/back buttons along with the microphone and a very small and hard to find led power light.  Even after looking at the illustration in the instructions, the LED is in a location that is hard to find and the light so small it is really hard to see.  It is actually easier to find the microphone port than this little white light.  The buttons on the control worked for both phones but are also a bit small and the function symbols are not marked very well and blend into the dark buttons.<br /><br />The head set charged (accessible by opening a small rubber cover on the right ear piece tip) in about 2 hours and gets only about 4 hours of play time.  Since I now have both an Apple and Android phone in the household, I tested the headset with both.  Pairing (once I figured I had it powered on since I couldn't see the light) on both phones had no issues.  To my surprise, the Bluetooth range of this headset was pretty poor on both phones, cutting out at about 10 to 12 feet from them (I only managed to get to the door of my room before the headset cut out.), which is less than most headsets in this price range.<br /><br />This style of headphone tends to stick out of the ears a bit far but since I expected that it wasn't a surprise.  Comfort level, which has never been an issue with this brand, was just what I expected, especially with the Comply ear tips was very comfortable and did not sit heavily in my ears.  The ear pieces (made of metal) felt light in my ears but I did find that the ear anchors were necessary to help keep them in place.<br /><br />The call clarity on both phones was pretty good on both ends as long as the headset was in the range I indicated above.  Musically has always been where this brand has been good and this sound sounds ok but I found had way too much in the high range, drowning out the mid-range, and also lacking a bit in bass.  At lower volumes, the sound is more neutral and listenable but still sounds a bit high.  This was the first Brainwavz set that I found myself turning the volume down because the treble was just too much for me.<br /><br />The quality of the headset build is good and this is an ok first effort with a Bluetooth headset from Brainwavz but there are things that really keep it from being a great headset.  The design of the control with the small buttons that aren't marked well and the hard to see led light, the poor Bluetooth range and highs being too high for me bring the headsets rating down.  Maybe Brainwavz set the bar too high with its wired sets, but I feel this set doesn't match those in sound and design as those do.  This isn't a bad set by any means, but there is some room for improvement.  This set includes a one year warranty.<br /><br />3 stars<br /><br />I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.ts in this price range.

"I bought these buds for $35 as a relatively-cheap mid-level in-ear bud with ear and microphone. I expected them to last at least a little longer than the cheaper $10-20 buds, but no such luck. After about a month of daily use, the yellow strain protector on the audio jack has unsealed and broken away from the audio jack entirely, exposing the inner casing and metal wiring. Additionally, the connection between the microphone and button casings have broken and is now sliding around on the cable. I was not using or storing these in any excessive or aggressive ways.  Otherwise, sound is pretty good, as well as noise isolation. However, the cord transmits and amplifies practically any surface that it touches, which occasionally creates noises that I can't ignore and have to carefully shift myself and the cord around to avoid. Additionally, these buds produce just the faintest white noise in the right ear when plugging in to only my laptop audio, but it is not noticeable in my left ear.",positive
Couldn't use it and had to return because I bought the wrong one.,negative
It worked great when I got it but after about 2 weeks it just stopped working completely. Maybe one of my roommates tried ripping it out or something but to my knowledge it was just pretty flimsy.,positive
The first time I removed the USB end from my USB port the plastic housing surrounding the electronics separated from the electronics and slid down the cord. No thank you.,positive
They work just about as good as the other china junk betteries that say 1 jillion mah.  Im wishing i got orbtronic or eagle tac instead of these. I use mine mostly in high end flashlights 500+ lumens and i do not get the runtimes i should. Eagle tac makes a great cr123 that i shoukd have purchased instead of these. I lucked out with some ebl batteries aswell but they only have those in 18650. If you can fit 2 cr123s id sugest that you use 18650s instead.  Im giving these 2 stars because they work and ive had 2 get too hot to even touch and they still work so they are ok but short run times. In short Please purchase a better bettery.,positive
"acceptable sound for the price, next time ill definitely look for one with bluetooth...",negative
"I am only giving this product 1 star because it is a requirement of posting a review. The very best that can be said about the product is that it fits into the outlets in Switzerland. However, despite its name, &#34;Seven Star Transformer 200W Step Down 220/110 + Switzerland Travel Adapter Plug,&#34; it is NOT the correct current (Switzerland uses J current). Thus, on our recent trip to Switzerland, we completely blew the power in our hotel and had to ask the front desk to replace a fuse/trip the breaker to restore service. Further, my Conair Infinity Pro ($100) was fried by an electrical surge about 30 seconds after being plugged into this adapter/converter. In addition to being an expensive mishap, my hair was a frizzy mess for the remainder of the trip since the one styling tools I brought was ruined. Do not trust this product!!!",positive

"Noise-cancelling?  They do, somewhat.  After trying the Bose models, I can say these don't come close.  They do cancel out the 'white' noise from A/C units, nearby quiet conversations and generic transportation noise.  For the $36, you get a small taste of what noise-cancelling tech can do.  With this model, I will concede that they have GREAT audio drivers and the sound is impeccable.  I won't send them back, but I would not recommend these over the $300 models that actually do cancel external audio.",positive
Great sound for such a small box..good range plus deep adjustable bass.Use it frequently at home with my phone and tablet music collections. Sound range up to 30-40 ft with no lost in quality.,positive

"This cable served its purpose faithfully and excellently for nearly two years.  I bought this back in the fall of 2013, and just yesterday, it ended up no longer working.  I had been using it with my mid-2013 MacBook Air and an ASUS monitor, and had no issues getting it connected right from the start.  Recently, however, I noticed that the cable was no longer connecting as tightly with my Mac's Mini DisplayPort, and though it still established a connection with the HDMI port of the monitor, it was extremely easy to disconnect from my MBA.  Today, the cable unplugs with even the slightest touch from the port on my MBA, and there is no sign of any connection between my laptop and the monitor.  I had my roommate try connecting with his MacBook, and it failed to connect for him as well, and strangely enough, once he attempted the connection with my cable, he wasn't able to connect back using his own cable until he restarted his computer.  The cable must somehow be causing some electrical connectivity issue as well.<br /><br />All in all, I only paid $4.20 for the cable, and it was a convenient and easy way to use my MBA as a desktop computer, and I am thoroughly satisfied with the purchase.  Not the best cable quality, but I'd say it was worth the price!",positive

"&#34;Volume down&#34; button does not work. Volume up works, play / pause / siri button works, (though finicky), but the volume down button does nothing.<br /><br />Pretty disappointed. Sound quality was not what I expected either. Hoping I got a lemon here...",negative
"I bought these from BestBuy a few weeks back, and I am incredibly disappointed with their shockingly poor quality.<br /><br />After using them regularly, I suddenly noticed that the left-channel was slightly softer than the right-channel. This situation continued until the audio in the right-channel unexpectedly decided one day to disappear entirely.<br /><br />I suspect that the wiring inside the earbud has broken, and this should tell you everything you need to know about its poor construction.<br /><br />Now, the left-channel is barely functioning and sounds muffled one minute and then fine the next. Again, I suspect the poor construction is the culprit.<br /><br />I could technically RMA them to Sony as it is within 30 days, but I don't see the point on wasting money on shipping that could go towards a better pair from a different manufacturer.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't buy, or you'll regret it.",negative

Great cable. Fits my HD598s perfectly and the red cable with black sleeving matches the brown on the headset much better than the black cable that came with the headphones. The included 1/4&#34; screw-on adapter is very high quality and the spring-style is a unique touch that matches the connectors very well. Definitely a great upgrade if you want something that looks or feels different from the stock cable or need a replacement cable.,positive

"**Update**<br />After using this product for a few months, I can no longer turn it off. So the battery just dies. Can't figure it out, but it stinks. But if you are looking for something that only works for a couple months, this is your gadget!!<br /><br />**Original Post**<br />This is pretty good little speaker. Understandably the quality of the speaker isn't top of the line, but it gets the job done. I get to listen to music in the shower and bring out my inner Celine, okay so I probably don't sound like her, but that's beside the point. Setting this little guy up is fairly simple, just gotta charge it first. It would be awesome if the cord to charge actually came with the part to plug it in to an outlet, but for 14 bucks, that might be a lot to ask. I will say that syncing the blue tooth up for an android is far easier than on my iphone, but the quality you get is about that same. It does stream a lot better when you are listening to music from your music library vs. pandora. The phone button is pretty sweet, I called my boyfriend the other day and didn't realize he was in the shower and he answered the phone. Quality of the call wasn't too bad, obviously the shower was a little loud and kind of muffled his voice. But hey, it worked! I've seen some people complain about the suction cup and the speaker falling. I will say, we put it in the shower and not 5 minutes later it fell down. But, since we re-stuck it on the wall, it hasn't fallen in a week. For the money it is a good little speaker, and I would probably recommend it to others.",negative
"Lamp blew 58 days after installation, slightly beyond the 30 day return policy(ironic). Yes,  installation was a breeze, the whole 1 screw, however function is trash... My original lamp was 6 yrs old, this one made it 58 days.",positive
I think it's pretty good. It charges batteries like it's supposed to.,positive
"I was so excited to see this 20' cable spring to crystal clear life on my 4tv at 60Hz (UHD color enabled), but after some testing, it became apparent that the cable is just too long to sustain the signal. I'm running this from a GTX 980 to a Samsung 65&#34; TV (JS9500 model). It starts off without any problems, but the picture will then cut out anywhere between 1 to 10 minutes. It will then either a) spring back to life, b) no longer be recognized by the TV until switching the source over and back, or c) return with the white speckles so synonymous with weaker 4k connections. It's such a shame, as clearly its 'almost' there but the length is just too much to maintain a solid signal.  I'm giving this 3 stars so the review will be easier to identify for those looking for a similar solution to me, but I do think the overall quality of the cable here is top shelf; definitely the best 20' I've tested so far. I just think anything over 10-15 feet is currently inadequate to push 4k @60Hz. For now I'll just have to keep lugging my PC over to my TV every time I want to enjoy some couch based 4k gaming.",negative
got this to throw in the bag for a pool day or beach. Bonus was the fact that you can answer calls hands free !! Sound is as expected . Would prefer if it had an ac charger. It has to charge via usb. So if you want to use it in the house has to be connected to the computer for longer use.,negative
"The product seems to work; however, they didn't send me a new unit.  The plastic was open, the twist ties were loose in the plastic, the cords weren't bound and instructions weren't included.<br /><br />Also, when I went online to foxnovo.com to register it (as instructed on a &#34;Lifetime Warranty&#34; card, it isn't a functioning website or in English.",negative

"I was impressed with this box, till I purchased a medium size Sony as a gift for a friend.<br /><br />The sound is not even close to Sony's",negative
Easy to set up and has controls that make sense.  Most cool small speaker system! Couldn't be happier with it.,positive
Good quality speaker. Not as loud as I thought it would be. Overall a good deal. I would recommend.,positive
"Decent sounding speaker. Easy to pair to an S5 and an iPhone 5s. They give you a foam pad to keep the speaker from walking due to bass vibration but I think it's necessity is wishful thinking on Cambridges part. Although the sound is nice and clear, I see no evidence of bass response being anywhere near powerful enough to cause walking. In spite of this I am pleased with my purchase and others have complimented the sound. Good value at this price point.",positive
Received and used same day. Plugged in second day and the internal contacts broke. Ruined the recording of a live production.,negative
I've been hunting for a item like this for a long time and I'm very happy with this item.It males the long walk for work bearable.I've had this for a few months now and it is still going strong.Battery life is great as well.All in all it is great mp3.There is a issue that sometimes it turns off and wont come back on forcing me to do a reset but it is a quick fix.I would still recommend it.,positive
Battery does not stay charged so after a couple of days and not using it it goes dead.,positive
"I had to return this item as it stopped working within a week of receiving it.  I sent it back and a replacement was sent promptly.  So far, the new one is working as expected.  I love listening to the radio and music as I walk.  Perfect size.",positive
"compicated, roku dropped off control after 6 days.  returned.",negative
"volume does not go very loud, battery easy to leave on based on design",positive
if i were u stay clear of this cable . i installed this cable to the monitor all i got was the black screen  and nothing else so i shot them an e mail but never get any response back .,positive
"Pretty good for the price. The stand is a bit more loosely connected to the base than I would like, so not a 5 star product for that, but it's not enough to notice much or be a problem. Looks nice as well and reasonably priced.",negative
"I was able to get a Bluetooth connection to my Dish receiver. After that, no connection. Please replace ASAP.",positive
They do a nice job and the liquid does not evaporate like the wipes do.,positive
"I cannot recommend these because of the interference, strange noises, and automatic volume adjustment.<br /><br />I did a lot of research into wireless headphones before buying these.  There are not very many options, so these might be the best at this price, but they still aren't very good.  I have been using these daily for four months, and I can't recommend them.<br /><br />I really like the battery life (I use them for 3-4 hours a day and charge them every 2 or 3 days, and they haven't died on me), and the batteries are replaceable/rechargeable AAA batteries, but the poor sound quality ruins the product for me.<br /><br />I would recommend choosing a wired solution, looking at a higher-end set, and/or waiting for a better set of wireless headphones.<br /><br />Also, they aren't very comfortable after 30 min or so.  They press down on my ears and make them hurt.",positive
"This unit is not even worth the low price!  It's made very cheaply, has had sound/speaker issues since day one, and while we've only had it a few months, the LED display goes out daily and we can't even see the stations, etc.  We should have returned the unit for a refund when we started having issues, and now we are out of warranty and unable to do so.  It literally will go in the garbage.  Do not waste your money on this unit, but spend a few more dollars for something of more quality.",negative
"It plays my downloaded mp3's and that's what I needed. They could've put &#34;Play&#34; on the button or Stop, or Pause, but instead they put words that made no sense to me. So, if you are the only one playing it, you'll have to remember which buttons do what. Another thing... when you do find a song you want to play and hit the button, it takes a few seconds longer than I'd like. I might be getting nit picky here, but when I'm in front of the class I wish it would play quicker.",positive
"Originally when I bought these headphones, I thought they were really nice headphones, but for some reason broke after 3 months of use. However, the team at Symphonized went above and beyond replacing my headphones for free, and these new ones haven't showed any of the signs of wear that the original ones did, and it's been over 3 months since the replacement.  Edit: Scratch that, literally two days after I updated this review, they broke again. Almost at the exact same period of me owning them. Getting a little ridiculous now.",negative
It was awesome at first very loud speaker but now it seems not to have as much sound and it acts up alot trying to hook it up to Bluetooth,positive
These were bought to power a scooter and once installed they worked out great.,positive
"Initially I though that this is a totally waste of time. It feels like junk, its poorly designed, and comes with no instructions for Mac, has no instructions for Mac online, will not work with iTunes.   Typical crap from China, and the build quality of the product is not worth the price, But OMG the sound quality blows iPod nano out of the water it sounds fabulous with my Klipsch ear buds, way better than Apple. Too bad its so poorly designed and constructed. I doubt it will last me 6 months.   Its cheap but sound quality is very very good. Its overpriced considering how poorly its designed and constructed.",positive
Bluetooth kept cutting out. I sent it back. Probably works fine if you keep your phone close to the speaker.,negative
Was not as advertised.  Did not have the speaker outlet I needed.,positive
Buyer beware. PAINFULLY overpriced! Parts includes are worth no more than a dollar. Made in the USA should not equal price gouging your customers. See image. Going to return based on price. Works well if you are ok with the crazy markup.,positive
"I am a purchaser of the previous release model, Phonomena 1. This unit has worked perfectly in my system for 3 years so far. The sound is clean, crisp and clear.  I would buy one again if I need another phono pre-amp.",positive
"I bought this because my receiver needed an analog audio out put for the second zone of speakers I have on my deck.  Normally, I just use AppleTV for streaming audio, but since the Apple TV is digital, my receiver's analog-only second zone will not amplify an HDMI source.<br /><br />When I want to play music on my second zone of speakers on my deck I can either play from my headphone jack (corded) or use one of these Bluetooth to analog wireless receivers.  This receiver works great but it will not play from my deck which is about 15' from the receiver.  Granted there is also an external wall between the receiver and the deck.<br /><br />If you need a similar solution as I did, keep looking.  This receiver is great but just not powerful enough to do the job I needed it to do.",positive
"In practice, the sides don't do a great job of holding cables in.  Ditched these rather quickly in favor of velcro straps.",positive
"Maybe not the BEST headphones ever, but you can't even come close to something this good for the price.  I highly recommend them for drummers.  I use them with a metronome while playing with my band.",positive
It's ehh. My uncle has a hard time connecting it to Bluetooth. The speaker itself looks really nice.,negative
"The user's manual that came with the product specifies that you can connect a projector or HDTV/LCD monitor through VGA to a HDMI device such as a PC or a laptop. I was trying to connect my LCD monitor to my PC so I was using this product correctly following the user's manual. Unfortunately, it did not work for me at all. My LCD monitor had a black screen. I tested it on my HDTV monitor in case that it was my LCD monitor that was malfunctioning however, my HDTV monitor didn't detect any VGA cable. I switched back to my VGA-to-VGA cable to test both monitors and both monitors were working perfectly fine so it clearly is the product that doesn't work. I would NOT recommend anyone to buy this product. Save your money or look somewhere else.",positive
"Love the flexibilty of the mount except that I can not tilt the tv downward. It would help because during certain times of the day I struggle to see the screen because of the sunlight. Hopefully you place the tv in a location where that is not an issue. Other then that, this mount serves its purpose.",positive
I have these under an Oppo BDP-105D and I have to say I can tell absolutely no difference.,positive
This is a solid well made item and I like it a lot. I own 2. I just haven't completely figured out their function. I purchased them for one purpose that wound up being better serviced by a different product. I hope to incorporate them into one of my projects soon. Their bulk has turned out to be challenging to overcome.,positive

"I thought Ansmann sells good products, but this battery is very bad quality.<br />It isn't in a hard cover, the outside is just plastic foil, so that even in normal use it gets slightly compressed and then doesn't fit smoothly any more in the camera. It's a pain to get it out. Also the battery life is not very good.<br />I'm glad I have another battery from Lenmar which is superior in both ways.",positive
"I had high hopes for this device as it would have simplified life in one corner of the bedroom.<br />However, I don't know if it's the adapter circuitry or the cool light bar on the top, but one of them generates interference that makes impossible to hear the radio on the alarm clock. Due to delivery and lots of travel plans I was outside the time to return it, so I'll probably stick it in the kitchen or something, but the USB feature will really be useless there.<br />Giving it two stars since it does actually provide AC power and dual USB charging, so if you're set up to have this nowhere near a radio, you're probably good.",positive
"The sound is fine and they fit well in my ears. The problem is the around the ear part falls off continually, I almost lost one the first day I had them. Also the same part is kind of hard and uncomfortable. I bought these because I had an old pair of yurbuds that I loved but got old and fell apart. These are not nearly as comfortable.",negative
Good item the only thing is the usb is really slow at charging.,negative
"The speakers sound awesome.  They were not fancy but I thought they looked fine.  Besides, who cares what they look like, they sound great.",positive
I have a problem with turning off the Sony Walkman. The instructions say to press the middle button to put the player in a pause mode. Then press the options button and hold it down to turn off the MP-3 player. I did that a number of times an the screen says the players in an on hold mode. But it continues to play.  Any idea as to how to turn this thing off???????/,negative
"I gave this 2 stars because there really are no competitors, so you might need to suffer with this product like I do.  First hardware wise - this thing gets hot sitting in a car.  I live middle (latitude wise) of thhe USA, yet this thing cannot be used when I get into my car.  I have to put it in the AC vent on max for 5 minutes to even use it.  If you live in the South, you'd really be in trouble.  Rather than a smooth back to &#34;look cool&#34;, simply making a ripple pattern would give 3 times the surface area and dissipate heat more quickly.  Apple likes sleek over useful when it comes to hardware design.  I like being able to download podcasts over wifi on this.  But, for some reason I can come back to my car in the morring, and this this went from 100% batery to dangerously low.  I know have airplane mode on, but still there is unknown battery use.  By putting all features on screen, with no physical buttons, it is hard to use in a moving car.  I mean a passenger shifting around in normal driving will push the wrong thing.  80% of the screen is taken up with the title (and possible cover art) when playing music - why?  Then the scrolling title (which I'd much rather see in the 80% all at once).  There is no feature to skip forward or backwards just a little.  My podcast player (3rd party software) on the ipod has a 30 second skip which is handy if you miss something.  This has skip to next track only.  Clearly this device was made for music only.  But 64GB is a ton of music, and really the size for people like me who want to listen to lectures and audiobooks.  The button for play is vright next to the volume slide.  Many times I'll try to push play/pause and end up making my sound go to 50% (mid point on slider).  I have normal, man sized hands.  Beside no skip forward, just like the terrible clickwheel of the prior ipod, there is a slider to move around the track.  But if your track is 1 minute, each millimeter on the screen may represent 5 seconds.  If youhave a 45 minute lecture, you may not be able to finely click within 5 minutes.  It should not be a percent of total track time, should allow 30 second forward/backwards.  If you miss something, you are not going to hear it again, sorry.  And a huge complaint that happens to me everytime I listen to an audiobook is the dumb SHUFFLE feature is always on by default.  When you are listening to an audiobook (or even a classical score of music that goes in order), this feature is very annoying.  There is no way to turn it off by default - once you start playing a new album, you need to click shuffle off (EVERY time you go to a new book!).  They have something in settings for shake to shuffle off (which I do have off), but that is a really useless feature.  So, hard to navigate, cannot back up to listen to a passage in a book you want to hear again, auto shuffle so the story you are listening to seems to skip, and the thing gets overheated in mild summer weather.  Really a huge dissapointment.  I've searched here for other players, there is almsot nothing.  This product sells because there is no competition.  So buy it, but you may find yourself cussing a lot. Update July 2015.  Even after updating IOS to 8.04 still buggy.  If you have this in your car, where it gets hot, it WILL reset itself due to temperature - you will lose your place in any book chapter or long file.  Awful for listening to Audible or other books.  I just dusted off my old clickwheel ipod and came out to my car after it sat all day in the sun - the old Ipod turned right on and resumed my book where I was.  Yes, the old clickwheel model does not have wifi, or apps, but it works in the heat, doesn't random battery drain, and was a better!",negative
Yes i tried it on my portable digital tv and got 4 chanels,positive
Great remote and delivery.<br /><br />Only issue was that they don't include codes or directions for synching with everything.,positive
Do not buy this to use in gym! I wish I had listened to other reviewers. It seems that you have to be facing a particular direction to pick up the gym frequencies and that does not always seem consistent. I assume the signal in the gym is just not strong enough. It picks up local radio stations fine and I would recommend it for that.,negative
"very nice, I use it in my latest travel and it works very well inside the airplane.",positive
Good clock<br />I like the FM radio I set it as alarm :) it did the job,positive
It is a used remote - I used it for my small kitchen tv - all the buttons work with the exception of the on and off button.  Since it since not a major thing for me to do this manually and I can change channels etc with the remote I will keep it.  Just a little disappointed that the on and off button does not function.,negative

"Hurt my ears. It might just be me, but I do not like this new trend of ear buds that &#34;tunnel&#34; into your ear. They may work for you, so they're worth a try. Sound was good. These just felt like they dug way too deep into my ear. Even the smallest size was painful. After an hour of use, my ears were sore. I prefer a round earbud.",positive
Used it for 2 years till the jack became disconnected with the rubber band. The sound quality was good. However the microphonics phenomenon was quite obvious.,positive
"I have run the same mildly scuffed CD through this machine about 10  times now using the yellow &#34;repair&#34; pads and 5 times with the rougher red/pink &#34;buffing&#34; pads on a second equally scuffed CD to compare. . . and there is none. Neither has any sign of repair scuffing (see pic). What a gimmick. It is definitely going back to Amazon.<br /><br />FYI, this appears to be the exact same thing as the Monoprice 105164 Cleaning and Repairing Kit for CD/DVD media that has same accusations that the &#34;red&#34; pads work better than the &#34;yellow&#34; pads.",positive
"The sound is actually quite good, except for a quiet buzz in the background which is only audible during quiet passages.  However, the buzzing becomes quite pronounced whenever I touch any part of the amp, to include the volume knob.  My best guess is that this is caused by 60 Hz getting through the incredibly cheap power supply provided.  I'm thinking of trying a different power supply, but really this item should come with one that is suitable for the amp.",positive
"The speaker had good sound, but it was of poor quality in craftsmanship.  It stopped working within a day, so we returned it.  I will give credit to the company for processing our refund promptly.",negative
"I love these headphones!  I am in my zone when I put these on.  The only problem is since they are not wireless I broke my phone when I was moving my arms too much on the treadmill so I had to purchase some wireless headphone.  Great price, great headphones!",positive

Lithium battery was included but did not say how the battery will be recharge and no explanation on what are the led lights for?  They blink steady and one that stay on but no explanation what does it mean.  Very confusing, look at on online regarding the NewEar there is not much information, they only way is to go back to Amazon.",negative

"I just moved into an apartment three months ago, which included a free DirectTV box to use, but the box doesn't include the local channels for some reason. I was looking for a solution to this, being that Football and Fall TV season is upon us, until a friend of mine recommended this product. So for $7 I figured why not?<br /><br />It has performed as expected. Signal is clear and I get all my local channels again, along with a few other ones.<br /><br />Again, I was only looking to receive my local channels and anything else was a bonus in my eyes. People looking for a robust amount of channels may come away disappointed.<br /><br />Great product!",negative
"Really flimsy parts. I wouldn't count on using there for any really serious applications, specifically anything more than around 50W of power. Also took over a month to arrive. I forgot I even ordered them.",positive

"I'm a big fan of the Noontec headphone line, they are my absolute favorite headphones, hands down. When I was asked to try the<br />[[ASIN:B00Q8I0ELS Noontec Rio S Earbuds]], I jumped at the opportunity because I know their brand for amazing quality and sound. These are perfect when space is a premium, but are also easy on my budget.<br /><br />The Rio S earbuds are ultra portable and have smart design features. First, a flat cable designed for anti-tangle resistance. They are generally impossible to knot, I have tried. I like to watch films and podcasts on my tablet, these are perfect for that, clear and crisp voices. Music is just as good, good strong bass.<br /><br />Generally, the [[ASIN:B00Q8I0ELS Noontec Rio S Earbuds]] perform very well and meet my expectations for a dependable and quality pair of headphones. I typically do not care for in-ear headphones because they are often so hard to get a good fit, however I feel with the included variety ear adapters, most users will find the perfect fit I found.<br /><br />[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]",positive

"Started out fine, then stopped working after a few months. Gave these to my daughter in March, and they worked well. She used them often with no problem. Then after a few months, the sound would go in and out. She'd be listening, then no sound, then it would come back. Very annoying. I was hoping to get a year out of them.",negative
"Best compact, multi-use headphones I've used in awhile. Been using them for about 6 months now and I've really enjoyed them. The only downside I've had with them is that they sent me white when I ordered the black but I grew to like them. Although after about 4 hours of use they do tend to fatigue",positive
"I purchased this for my toddler and after only having it for 2 months, it started turning off in the middle of a CD playing. It wouldn't repeat songs when the repeat button was pushed.

"(NOTE : This review is for version 1 of the X1.  FiiO has since released (early 2016) a 2nd generation X1, which appears to be significantly different.  Please keep that in mind as you read this...)<br /><br />&#34;Hey, check out this awesome, shiny microwave!  It's big enough to cook a whole turkey!  It won't actually COOK the whole turkey, but it's big enough to hold it.&#34;<br /><br />That's analogous to Fiio's functionality.  The product description says:<br />&#34;The X1 has a microSD slot that supports SDXC cards, currently up to 128GB, large enough to hold your entire music library.&#34;<br /><br />Yes, it does support the 128GB card, and you can actually play every song--if you can find them... a folder at a time.<br />The problem lies in the fact that the current firmware supports only 5800 songs.  Once it indexes those, the rest of the songs are hidden from any searches you do.  I like to play by &#34;genre&#34;, but that's out for any song not indexed.  For a player that supports a 128GB card, it does a pretty bad job at supporting the media that you can store in 128GB, which pretty much makes the player useless for me, as my collection is over 11,000 tracks.<br /><br />The player itself looks great, sounds great, feels very solid, and has decent battery life--all great steps toward making it a wonderful media player.  But not being able to find the media to actually play it, wrecks the whole thing.<br /><br />You can read about the issue on Fiio's forums, with Fiio commenting that the issue will be fixed in a future version of the firmware.  Though people have been complaining about the issue since at least January (2015), the last comment I could find from Fiio came in June (2015), with a promise of a fix that will &#34;take much time&#34;.  No word since then.<br /><br />Now I am stuck with a dilemma; deal with the hassle of returning the player which does not perform as advertised, or wait in hopes that Fiio follows through with their promise of a firmware upgrade.  If they do, my star rating changes to 5.  Until then, they get 2 stars for a player that doesn't work properly, AND for advertising it in a way that makes it sound like it will.<br /><br />UPDATE : 10/3/2015 - Fiio came out with an updated firmware on 9/18/15.  FW1.5 fixes the 5800 limit as well as adding support for more languages, gapless playback, and more.  Updating my rating to 4 stars.  I'm sure many people will be very happy about the removal of the 5800 limit!<br /><br />UPDATE : 2/26/2016 - While the 1.5 firmware does now allow over 5800 songs to be indexed, it slows down navigation significantly.  Try the following: navigate by album and start playing a song.  If you then decide you want to play a different album, you just click &#34;back&#34; to go up to choose something different.  It can take several seconds before the navigation happens.  If you've navigated multiple levels, (say genre / pop / all songs) and want to go back multiple levels, you're looking at taking up to a minute to go back up and then drill back down somewhere else.  Once you've started playing, everything is fine, but the navigation itself is painfully slow when you've loaded a lot of songs (in my case, 15,295).

It had been slowly getting worse, and now it's to the point of being unusable.  I guess it couldn't handle scrolling through hundreds of songs over and over.  It lasted about 1 year, which is pretty sad in my opinion.  The only thing that saves this device is the fact that there are two navigation buttons that handle the same functionality as the scroll wheel.  Whew!

For something so expensive I feel that I shouldn't have to troubleshoot every time I want to use it.  It worked fine for a while and now every single time I try to play music it can't find the server and requires me to reset things.  Every time.  I love the idea but am not sure I will be getting any more.  For what it's worth I know other people who have not had these problems at all so I'm not entirely sure what the issue is.,positive
"Good little device, plenty of room for music, but cheap look on the outsides of the device makes me worry a bit how long it will last.  It won't download directly from DVD-RW I had to download music to my computer and then upload to device. Still, I am enjoying it, and love taking walks while being plugged in.",positive
"This player is an absolute fraud. the system is horrible to use you cant play playlists. its just a cheap knockoff, I hope apple sues them. I want my money back...",negative
"There is a tiny screen covering the sound hole that tore away when I struggled to install a different size silicone ear plug. I think the screen fell down the hole. Sound seems unaffected, however, so I'll leave it alone. Silicone plugs are sized too snug to install easily. Took me a good 15 minutes to get one on.  I had the knack of it by the time I got to the other one, but by then the damage on the first one was done.",positive
doesnt always give great signal.  Have to adjust on the wall time to time,positive
"Had the Vizio sound bar for about 6 months and the remote gave out.  A great replacement for the original, but beware I've heard that even the replacements can go out eventually.",positive
"I needed to run the HDMI output into an EyeTV-HD for recording on my computer. It connected OK, but only at composite quality, never at HD quality. The old style composite connection gave just as good results. I gave it to my son who has devices which don't have composite.",positive
Received them yesterday afternoon. They worked once out of the box but would not power up this morning even after a full charge. I haven't even owned them for 24 hours and am returning them to amazon right now.,negative
The cord keeps slipping out of the clip. The clip should be large to fit securely around the band.,negative
Smaller than I thought. Sound isn't as good as the larger ones.,positive
i received a defective product¡¡¡¡¡¡  very dessappointed with amazon ¡¡¡,positive
"And another great item by Beluga, I've been using beluga products for a while now and I can't seem to find anything better in the market. These cables work great for all my chargers and game cables.",positive
Great product. Will save money on batteries since so many household items take batteries now. They work great so far. Would recommend if you use a lot of batteries now.,positive
"As they say these low cost items, if they work they are as good as the high priced models",positive
Work great on windows xp and 8.1 opens new possibility for cw beacon,positive
"The Audio Output sporadically dies for no discernable reason. You pause a movie and come back, and BAM - it's not working. It can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes to fix. And when it is fixed, you are still left clueless as to why it is now working.<br /><br />If you have this, just keep switching the 2CH & 5.1CH. If you are lucky, it will eventually start working again. For a time.",positive
It is not water proof. Used it in the shower 2 twice and now the battery will not last more than 10 minutes,negative
"only problem is the entire left outputs often just stop working, and this annoys me. (Update: after one year, left channel now always sounds terrible, crackles, and is just really really low quality.",negative
"Drops signal if you're flipping songs.  Best to create a playlist and just let it go.  Sound quality not up to claims.  Was envisioning having several of these to place around the house, but, I think I'm going to relegate it to patio duty only.",positive
"For an inexpensive radio for a senior citizen to listen to in the back yard .. it's fine. My mother in law is not up with technology, so the fewer buttons the better. Sounds a little tinny .. but not bad for the price",negative
i've tested it and it works - it flares out a bit too much for my way of thinking.,negative
"These work great, I love them. They look just like plain earplugs. Just wish they would last longer, I'm on my second set.",positive
"I purchased this product, and found that the product was too tight on my head. After a couple months of use the headphones snapped under very little pressure.",negative
This stopped working within 2 weeks of when it was received. I could not be more disappointed.,negative
HDMI CEC works maybe 20% of the time. Interface is clunky at best. Does its job and thats it.,positive
Arrived very fast! Looks really nice! This was a gift and my boyfriend loves it!,positive
Wow. This lamp didn't even last a month. This is very poor.,negative
"For the price point of these headphones they are fine. The buds come with a choice of sizes to go into the ear canal, the coverings are soft. The gold looks nicer in my ears than boring black but of course this is not my main factor for choice in earphones. I wear these when walking my dogs because bluetooth headphones do not operate efficiently in my neighborhood. I also wear them in bed so comfort is essential.  For travel these are so compact it is easy to use them in the gym. I had them on while the yard was being mowed and with the volume turned up I could hear my audiobook. The connection to my Galaxy phone interlocked securely.",negative
about the same reception as my 35 mile antenna - a little disappointed it was not stronger reception,negative
The speakers were cheaply made and broke within the 1st wk purchase.,positive
Simply excellent banana plugs. Quality construction; quick and easy to install speaker wires into plugs; and no-slip plug connection into av receiver ports. Very nice product!,positive
"These are advertised as 18650, but are too big to fit in my device. After a bit of tinkering, it turns out these are actually made by Samsung and then Foxnovo adds some type of circuits to prevent overheating and stuff. This is not a bad thing by itself, but these items are added on top and below the original cell and wrapped up in a thick film to keep it together. The result of these additions is that they will not fit into my device.<br /><br />I had to cut all that stuff off to use them.<br /><br />These also don't feel like hi drain cells. The drain is actually pretty meh.",negative
"Many people have problems with earphones. Either they don't fit, don't sound clear, break easily, or are just too expensive. Well, here's my review for these earphones. They are designed with rubber heads that are tilted sideways, so they ACTUALLY have the ability to fit and stay in your ear, with multiple sizes for those of you (like me) who think their earholes are physically challenged. Anyway, the RPHJE120R's sound great. Really, for the price, they sound just as good if not better than apple's 30$ earphones. No complaints in that department. In terms of physical quality, I do not know how easy it is to have them break, but most people suffer the plague of one ear not working and the works. It happens, I suggest buying a small case to wrap your headphones in, instead of tossing them around or shoving them in your pocket, that's how they break. It is a huge bang for the buck!",negative
Sony doesnt make a bad headphone. Quality down to the bottom of the product range.,negative
"Bought these batteries as a spare set. In a Kangertech Subox mini and running a 0.4 ohm build, I can not run over 30 watts, and then when running at 30 watts only about half of the battery is used up on the gauge before it can no longer put out the needed amperage to run the coil. Works good for a spare while your normal battery charges, but that seems to be about it.",positive
"Ok product. Positive, good color, size & sound.  Negative, no volume on unit, Big negative. Also heavy to hook on backpack . Need to amend review.  Volume as others stated with forward & reverse buttons.  Not user friendly, timing has to be right or you change song, also hard to adjust volume or you cut off sound completely.  I own a few other Bluetooth players, with separate volume control, much better products out there.",positive
"I purchased these for my six-year-old daughter to use on our trip to Colorado this summer.  She loves these and I love the fact that she can't turn it up too loudly, and that they fold down into a convenient travel size.  Satisfied customer.",positive
I don't think it was meant for a nabi.  My experience is that the plug won't fit into the nabi.  Its loose therefore it wont charge all the way.  You have to play with it to make sure it is in correctly and it will charge.  :(  Very frustrating!,negative
Love this little record player!!! Got it for my mothers birthday and we spent the whole day listening to her old albums and she had the biggest smile on her face! It had been years since she last heard her records. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because the sound doesn't go very loud. Now I understand you get what you pay for but I just expected it to be a bit louder than what it is...simple fix because you can hook it up to speakers but for my mom is just an extra hassle. Other than that this is a great record player!,positive
They work wonderfully for regular hd and uhd at 60hz.  The picture is very good quality. Im very happy with these wires.,positive
"I installed this unit in order to get channels for my TiVo OTA. It failed to get even a single channel to display, so I still cannot use many of the device's features. I had really low expectations for this product and it still fell short.",positive
"Update .    The company contacted me and sent me another one to try at no charge.  So in regards to this company I can say they stand  by their product and will try to fix issues.   I still have discharge  issues now and then with the 2nd one but I would say buy without fear that you would be stuck without a exchange.  So I am changing from 2 stars to 4 based on the customer service.   I have now tried various combinations of batteries and Radioshack and Energizer brands. When using D size batteries I am finding that its either not fully discharging and then its also not fully recharging my D size batteries regardless of the brand I am using.  Sometimes it will charge 1 out of 4 fully and the other will sit and never charge up.  Then I remove the uncharged ones and replace them in the charger and maybe one might recharge , and the others won't. I am guessing this is defective.",positive
"I know, it is hard to get excited over a humble cable, but I think it is always worth getting decent cables; I’ve spent a fortune on cabled for the TV and surround-sound system and I’m convinced it is worth every penny. This appears to be a very well manufactured cable; the gold plated jacks are a snug and positive fit and the junction with the cable is robust with no play while the cable itself seems uncommonly resistant to the usual Gordian knot syndrome.<br /><br />There is not much more to say -this is a robust and high quality cable and well worth the modest price tag. Thanks to Allreli for providing a free sample in return for an honest review.",positive
I am quite happy and satisfied with this purchase. Unfortunately I had to return the second one as I no longer required it.. Amazon is GREAT!!,positive
GREAT TOOLS I DO DIRECTV & DISHNETWORK INSTALLATION & THIS TOOLS ARE VERY STRONG IS WATH WE USED IN THE FIELD. I CAN RECOMMEND IT.,positive
"They work, or worked great, for a year or so and then they broke or just stopped working.",positive
"Sound isn't the best, battery has lasted through about 5 or 6 showers no problem. Great product for price.",positive
"Well, the price says it all. The cord has to be in the right position otherwise the volume is low.",negative
"Love this, really cleans my rings. My daughters and I had a little jewelry cleaning party in my house when this came in. Cleans just like the jewlers.",positive
"These are great CD-Rs. My only complaint is that there is very little room for a label on the disc. I know, I know the picture shows what they look like, but for some reason the pictures look there's more room to write on there than there actually is. 5 stars for product quality, 4 for not leaving me any room to write what it is!",positive
Installation was confusing and not easy to do more like putting together a jigsaw puzzle and I had to dismantle the main joint on the arm to get it to install on the wall,negative
Sound great for the price - feel comfortable in the ear.,positive
Great headphones but were not the ones in the picture,positive
"I should have read the reviews before I purchased this. I wanted a 16x2 display that I didn't have to mess around with soldering it myself. It was pre-soldered, and that's about the only positive thing about it. It's not what it looks like it should be. It has an RBG LED on it, but that's not the back light, it's just shining super bright in your face when you try to look at it. It does have a back light for the LCD display, but it's only blue. It does work with the Adafruit library if you plug it directly into the Raspberry Pi. I wanted to connect it with some other devices and it wasn't detected when I plugged it in though a breadboard with jumper wires and a bmp180 sensor also on the I2C bus.<br /><br />Don't buy this. There are other better options.",negative
"This is not a quality connector.  No pin-out diagram was provided and the contacts on the back of the connector are very small and have no hole in them.  Also, there is no connection for the outer shell except the shell itself.  I have not yet attempted to use it.",positive
"I use ties often as an aid with my arthritis - primarily as zipper pulls. I also use them to attach keys to rings,  reinforce the corners of the wire-grid shelving that is built from squares and is very lightweight, to secure appliance rollers beneath the wire shelving. An inexpensive assortment of sizes is difficult to find and this is a nice selection to keep around the home.",negative
"The material quality is very good, however the over-engineered plugs cause a poor connection as it wobbles in the jack. This cable may work just fine depending on the design of the center pin connection in the jack. The loose connection created distortion and vibrations on the floor would wake the sub-woofer up from standby mode. The split center plug can damage the jack connections. If I were to re-design the plug, I would eliminate the split center and make the outer coaxial connection a cylinder shape. The current design only grips from the tips and that causes the plug to wobble.",positive
"Knocks out our T.V. and internet as soon as we turn them on! We followed the directions and hooked them to the T.V., and immediately lost all cable signal. So my husband moved the connection to the stereo receiver,  but it still didn't work.  The headphones themselves did what they're supposed to do...let him listen to T.V. without the volume up, but after just a few minutes, they interfere with our wireless router and everything in the house fails...t.v., internet, ALL of it!!  Do NOT recommend buying these at all!!",positive
"Don't buy these unless you know what you are doing!  There was no disclaimer for those of us in an area where you no longer have analog TV.  I waited too long before I crawled behind the TV console to plug in and try, so I was unable to return this very expensive item.  Most of your customers have never bought one before, so give us the scoop on where these will work and where they will not.  I would have bought the right one had I known, but now cannot afford to!",positive
It was a piece of junk didnt even work it was a waste of time and money spent,negative
"3, cos they can EASILY crack! I did a test-drop, and from about 2-3 feet, the disc cracked! These are good replacement discs, BUT... be VERY careful!",positive
"Well made, does the job, can be top or bottom of tv.",negative
"Great stuff, easy to work with! One of the rolls was a slightly different color",positive
This system made it possible to hear our big screen TV that has a rear facing speaker.,negative
If you are looking for good sounding radio and projection on ceiling of time this is the best. Don't purchase it for the temperature of the outside. The inside temp is fine the outside unit keeps the temp on the screen for an hour or so and then it doesn't show anything but 2 lines for days. This is the second radio I had from Homedics and both were great sounds. Just disappointed about the temperature unit not working.,positive
Opened box and item is made with inferior materials. Power cord would not align to charge. Overall an awful product.,negative
"I have owned this headphones for almost a year right now. In short this is an almost very good bluetooth headphones. FYI, I am not a very audio sensitive person, all I can say in that regard it blows away my expectations for a bluetooth headphones in terms of sound.<br />Another thing to note is that it has a very good range. I can go wherever I want at home and it would still not drop the connection. I have just tested that it is good for at least 40ft (corner to corner at my home) and this is from a headphone that was used almost daily, recharged at least once a week for a full year. Still kicking.<br />It is very comfortable as well. To give you a reference, I have owned a Sennheiser HD 202 II at one point, couldn't wear it, it hurt so much. I have owned a Panasonic RP-HTF600-S which was too loose and I own Panasonic RP-HTX7 which fits perfectly. All of them are much cheaper corded headphones but I just wanted to list them so that you get a base line, everyone has a different head and ear structure so the comfort level would vary based on that.<br /><br />Now the bad: the build quality (this gets 1 star knocked off) please refer to the pictures for the damage. The side headbands are protected with plastic and inside there is the metal band. Metal will bend but the plastics will not as much as the metal. I have never abused it, just put it on my head and at about roughly 6 months, the plastic parts at both sides has shown cracks and then one side has finally separated roughly 3 months after. I guess when one side has separated, it reduced the tension on the other side but I think the plastic on that side will separate at some point in time too.<br /><br />Now the ugly (gets 2 starts knocked off): Although this is still in warranty, Sony will not repair or replace it as it is a physical damage. I told them it is due to their bad design where they used long curved plastic which will not bend like the metal inside but they won't listen. So beware, although the headphones is still kicking after almost one year, you would not get any support if the item shows such a physical damage like the ones mine has.<br /><br />UPDATED (8/18/2015)<br />The plastic piece on the other side has finally separated as well. At least now the damage is symmetric, I can finally rest easy :/",negative
"There is a flip door where you plug in your device. This door actually works against you so when you try to plug in, it gets wedged. The harder you push, the harder it sticks. I got tired of fighting it several minutes every time I needed to plug something in, so it got returned. Otherwise I liked yet compactness and versatility especially the USB ports. Fix the flip door and I'll buy it again.",negative
"Audiosharp AS1127:<br /><br />These happen to be the most comfortable pair of earbuds I reviewed from Audiosharp, and I like the black cord more than the designs of their other headphones. Again, like all of the Audiosharp products I tested, I had no trouble finding tips that fit snugly in my ear.<br /><br />The headphones came in a small pouch much like the leather pouches beats includes with their headphones. The sound quality was pretty mediocre but matches or exceeds the quality of headphones with a similar price. Overall, these are a nice pair of headphones, that are sturdy enough to get the job done.",positive
"Should have paid attention to the other reviews.  Had this less than a month, and the CD player quit working.",negative
"I thought the receiver would be fine to use in my garage as I was aware of the humming noise people were complaining about.  The Bluetooth feature does not work.  The remote is cheap.  The default when you turn the unit on goes to FM and it's loud.  I like the amount of power going to the speakers but there's no in between on volume control, it's either too loud or too low.  I really tried to make this work but it's not for me.  Bottom line &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.",negative
"This HMDX-HX-P470 portable speaker is a quite a bit smaller than I expected. It is about the size of a 5x7 picture and is only about an inch and a half thick.  It comes with a USB charge cable.  It lasts for 5 hours and works up to 30 feet away.  However for such a small package, the speaker really delivers on sound. It has excellent bass. This is perfect for a bedside speaker or for a desk.",positive
"The CD player never worked despite trying to clean it, which I should have never had to do since it was new!  Nice alarm clock, had the CD player worked.",negative
The old belt just fell apart - works well with new one,positive
"Sound quality-okay, not enough bass for a hip hop listener. Comfort-poor, cushions cheaply made, hurts behind ear, non adjustable, cannot lie down for bench press with out being uncomfortable. Stay in place - yes, fairly well. Looks/design- poor, sticks out and inch or 2 making you look like Frankenstein, feels cheap, non adjustable, and buttons are very hard to find. Overall- didn't like, especially for 50 dollars. Hoping to send back.",negative
Works well for the price. Cord outer shell is too brig for inner wires. Makes cord feel cheap,negative
Great speaker for the price.<br />It sounds way better than the 808 brand.,positive
"I already own one of these and loved it. I purchased this one and it didn't work. Called the company to get some help and were unable to get a hold of them. From what I understand, Coby is no longer in business.",positive
"i didnt purchase from anyonline online, 'twas a gift from a friend down teh street, but like most it does Wreck my wifi performance it drags my 25down/5 connection by 95%.  they sound great when using the optional &#34;Headphone&#34; Cable  and dont disrupt wifi that way but kinda makes the point of these things moot.",positive
"I'm not going to say I hate them, because maybe they just don't fit my ears. But when they're described as &#34;ergonomic&#34;, I guess I assumed they would fit in the ear a lot more comfortably. The actual hard part of the earbud seemed too big to fit in my ear, and the pads were very large. When I opened the package, the metal bit the connects the cord to the earbud was loose on one, and slid down the cord. I figured &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;, and maybe I just had to deal with sub-par earbuds if I wanted them to be inexpensive. But when I plugged them into my laptop to try them, the sound was horrible - like listening through a can on a string or something. The sounds was very muffled and tinny, and maybe it was because they didn't fit right, but I sent them back and got the Panasonic earbuds instead, which I am very happy with. I don't think I would recommend these to anyone.",positive
Sorry but in the process of returning the HDTV antenna. . Not usable in my area I can't catch any digital  channels. Also tried Clear HDTV antenna & still can&#34;t catch  any digital channels. Left to no choice but to get cable tv now. Live in rural area.,positive
"I don't hear anything out of one of the ear buds.  It's been like this since the second day I bought it but I thought maybe it was because I didn't plug the ear buds in right (somehow).  A couple of weeks later, only one ear bud plays music.<br />Still, the sound is quality and the ear buds are aesthetically pleasing",positive
"My sister got this for me as a Christmas present, at first I loved it, but now that I've had it for a few months the battery has completely gone to crap. At first I had to charge it every or every other day, which I could live with, but now it dies in a matter of minutes even after I've fully charged it. Super disappointing, don't waste your money.",positive
"Bought the first one a year ago and it worked as it should. However, I just ordered a new one and after about 3 weeks it looks as bad as the old bulb. Will have to return!!!",negative
These uave worked great for my factory job for abt 3 months before one headphone blewnout and then a month later thebother one. Wish they were more durable. They are definitely a sanity saver and I will likely replace them. Maybe the next pair will last longer.,positive
"This will be my second purchase of the UpBright AC/DC Adapter for my Maxwest tablet.  At first they work great, but after a few months of use the cable plug does not work properly. It is the same recurring problem.  I was very careful when plugging the tablet to charge. but again the charger part is getting loose and unless you hold it a certain way it will not charge.  This is not acceptable, but it is the only way to charge my tablet.",positive
Does what it needs to do and good price... just little bulky/larger than I expected but otherwise fine!,positive
"I bought this item to power a little O2 COOL portable fan I have that worked well on two D size batteries for years. It was still working well when I plugged it in to this piece of junk. I left it unattended for a half an hour and now my fan will only start running on two new D cell batteries, if I slap it against the palm of my hand a couple of times.<br />I'm hesitant to buy another &#34;better&#34; one for fear of a repeat performance.",positive
Pros:<br />Great sound<br />Easy navigation<br />Easily import track from iTunes via drag and drop<br />Excellent battery life<br /><br />Cons:<br />Will not import playlists as playlists<br />No bluetooth,positive
does exactly what I intended it to do. takes in anywhere from 5V-14.5V and outputs a Steady 5V. Works great.,positive
The product is great.... Just not for my teenage son who quickly lost it.,positive
"I mainly bought this to charge and refresh my rechargeable batteries.  I read the reviews and was sold on this product.  After receiving the unit everything about it rained premium.  The display and options are easy to understand and the unit does not get hot unlike others that I've had in the past.  The only downside is that sometimes some cells are not recognized.  After inserting the battery (AA) several times I get a NULL message.  I assume the battery is too drained or dead to pickup a charge and have tried every option to resurrect with no avail.  I throw these NULL batteries in a 15 year old charger and they charge right up, so unsure of what the deal is.  Overall the product is ok and has worked for the most part, my only con would be having to use multiple chargers...",negative
did not work. return shipping was mor than purchase price. replaced power cord with used one and radio worked. would not recommend this product. spend a few bucks more and get a sony or  other name brand.,negative
Update : I used these 3 times and the right ear stopped  working completely and the left one cuts out all the time.  Don't waste your time or money on this product.    I really like these headphones. They fit in my ear comfortably and don't fall out. The Bluetooth range on then is also pretty good. The sound quality in my opinion is also good. They only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it cuts out sometimes while you are listening to music or whatever. It did this several times yesterday even with the phone less that a for away. Not sure if it is a flaw in all of them or if I just got a defective one. Everything else about them is great though.,negative
"Awkward with the power box. Difficult to access the power box (for lack of a better term) to plug in as required for daily use. The headband is comfortable. I would suggest the company use Velcro to secure the box inside the headband, with an easy to access flap so that t can be plugged in easily. It should have more than one days' use on a charge. It doesn't. I actually prefer the one with the cord... But that one broke. I'm still waiting to get. New one back. The customer service is good... This item still needs a little tweaking to be a perfect item, but I like it. I wishe they would take my input and update their third version.",positive
"It is easy to set up and the software seems to be stable, but the overly complicated to operate and the buttons and small touch screen are all in the wrong place, its shape does not fit your hand and it is overpriced for what you get.  You would never believe that this remote was made by the producer of the Harmony One.",positive
I used this battery to replace the dead one in my wife's Altec Lansing bluetooth speaker.  It did the trick and now she can charge it and forget it.  I only gave it 4 stars to to the high price.  Look up you speaker model online and find the proper battery number.,positive
"The box doesn't work.  It came with no instructions, but I was able to validate that I was setting it up correctly via a YouTube video, and it isn't converting a clean image to the TV.",negative
Daily heavy use for 100W Eleaf & 150W Sigelei box mods.  Highly recommend.,negative
Product works perfectly as advertised and is much cheaper on this link than several other links floating around on Amazon. Cord is pretty long too which is good.,positive
Did not work.  Returned it.  Was more impressed with the ease of returning it than I was of the product itself.,negative
"Nicely made product, no problem there, but it just didn't work.  I have two major TV markets, one to the east another to the west and each about 25 miles away and it would not pick up a single station.",negative
"Look and feels very weak and flimsy. After many months, the cable doesn't want to retract all the way inside the &#34;case&#34;. Despite this, it still works and I'm happy with it.",positive
Works great on Reception TV! My IT guy installed in no time flat-easy breezy.,positive

These don't seem to last as long as the Panasonics.  I'm switching back to them as these wear out.  Not happy with short life.,positive
"The online instructions are pretty clear, and I was able to put the kit together in a little under four hours.<br />It has been ages since I soldered anything, so I had to buy a few tools, but nothing major.<br />The batter came charged, and the device came on right away with no problems after it was assembled. It started taking measurements right away, and got a gps lock in a few minutes.",negative
"Really disappointed in these. They seem to break easier than the one that came with it new. Even tried being as gentle as possible. They all break at the same point, where the ear hook connects to the ear piece. And yes they were made for this headset, Samsung HM1200.<br />Don't think I got my moneys worth. Sorry.",negative

"I write this review after testing these headphones for a good hour listening to music and podcasts. I also made a 20 minute phone call and here is what I think. Before I go into technicalities, the comfort level is excellent but I noticed even after trying several ear buds they do tend to get lose in ur ear and you have to keep sticking them back in when running or exercising.<br /><br />For music I give them a 2.5 and that's because even at there maximum volume they are not loud enough to enjoy if you were using them in a gym with loud public speakers. If you are looking for headphones which allow you to enjoy average volume music while keeping alert of your surroundings, these are great for you.<br /><br />For calls: the noise cancellation really does work beautifully! I tried them while driving with the AC on. I own a wrangler so the cabin noise is pretty noticable. I was told that the sound was very clear with zero background noise. These are easily my best headphones for making calls. Whenever I need to make a call that is more than 30 mins I wil only be using these.<br /><br />In conclusion<br /><br />Pros:<br />- very comfortable<br />- excellent sound clarity when making calls for myself and person I am speaking to<br />- great button placement with a switch Off/on button which makes it very easy to tell if the device is on or off without waiting waiting for any flashing light.<br />- NFC option which saves me a good 10-15 seconds to connect it to phone<br /><br />Cons:<br />- maximum volume not loud enough if you are in loud environment.<br />- tend to get lose in your ear if you are running<br />- range is not very good. after walking 8 - 10 meters away from it, it starts cutting out and sometimes even closer.<br /><br />To sum up. If you exercise in a loud gym or environment and want to drown out background sound these are not for you. However if you want to stay aware of your surroundings and don't mind wearing them when making long calls these are GREAT! Along with always keep the phone no further than 2 meters away from you.<br /><br />I definitely see my self buying another pair if those go bad in a year as they serve my personal purpose of use - but will not be my primary wireless bluetooth headphones.!

"We really liked this product. The sound is very good quality, considering the fact that you are underwater. It is very comfortable to wear and never interferes with my swimming. It was very easy to download songs and music onto the device. It's a little hard for me to change what is displayed on the screen. The screen locks and I have a hard time unlocking it. I have read the directions and kind find out how to unlock it. But that may be user error as well. But that is my one complaint. Everything else about this I really like. I love having my music to swim with - makes it much more enjoyable!",positive

"I purchased 2 units in Dec 2014. I used 1 and kept the other as a spare. For several months, I noticed rolling lines on some of my cameras. It wasn't too bad in the beginning but got so bad in July that I thought my DVR was going bad. I determined it was this power supply. I replaced it with my spare and my system is good again. It's only $20 bucks but it should last longer than 5-6 months. The power cord has a ground plug but the supply only has two prongs. Safety hazard? I called the vendor but I think it's a basement in N.J. They want me to return it so they can send it out for repair and send it back to me. I don't think so. IT COSTS $20.00! I have a Q-SEE system and I'm on my 4th power supply in three years. I have 16 cameras with two groups of eight. They all seem to be junk and man do they get hot. I need  a 12 V 5A if you have any suggestions.",negative
"This thing sucks, don't get it.  Terrible sound quality and the bluetooth stops working after about a month.  The only reason I gave it even one star was because it was cheap to buy and was actually waterproof...don't be fooled though, it sucks as a speaker.",negative
I bought this in the hopes of connecting my pc to the tv. Unfortunately my computer didnt have this DVI slot so I had to send the product back. Now my review reflects that because I bought the wrong cable so it was my fault. I will say however that they did ship it in a timely manner and everything appeared fine with the cord. Now i have to look for a different cable for my PC.,negative

Audio Warning! Will not output audio unless the source is outputting in mono or 2 ch stereo! This was listed in the second to last sentence in the description and was a major problem for me. I Intended to use this in conjunction with a HDMI splitter but it would be nice if it had built in decoding for the audio instead of relying on the source.,negative

"Wow. Yes, Wow.<br />At the $15 price point I wasn't expecting much, but these things really have a big sound. They were for my son, and he immediately put them through the paces playing songs with lots of low base, etc. We then tried the same device (pad, phone, etc.) and they outperformed anything else in the house. Admittedly we don't have any Beats or other expensive ear buds, but these easily sounded better than anything else.<br />quick note about the product, the packaging actually has AMPLITUDE High Sound In-Ear Headphones on package, Sentey name is in fine print on back.",negative
THE WIRES WORKED GREAT. I AM DRIVING MY WIFE CRAZY WITH THE SURROUND SOUND. BUT I'M HAPPY....,positive
"The bass thing is just vibrations in the ear piece, to give it the feel of strong bass. They are okay headphones but not fantastic. They have lasted a while though for the amount of use they get.",positive
"So I don't know if this is just mine or whatever, but there were so many little things that irritated me about this that I'm seriously considering returning it, after a few more days testing.<br />first, the item came to me and the case was smashed up, hard plastic casing, and someone had mangled it and hastily taped it back together with packing tape, which was arduous to get open. second, the buttons were all sticky and the controls were just flat out confusing. What broke the final straw is that after looking at it and seeing a mostly full battery after a good four hours of use, it died on me in the next 20 minutes without warning, displaying an empty battery sign when I tried to reboot it. It didn't even come with a standard mini-usb plug, as I found out when I tried to plug it into my portable battery, it uses some kind of weird fat deviation from it, so that's fun.<br />I'm not suggesting this is going to be common, but beware when buying this product.",positive

Poorly secures to most surfaces and does not keep a charge for more than 2hours. Also not a crisp sound at higher volume ranges.,negative
"I'm giving this product a 4 star rating because of the excellent anker customer care support and warranty. However, it should be noted, that this product has some glaring quality issues, the 1st of 2 developed a distorted sound issue and the 2nd has an issue with the Bluetooth receiver, hence would not produce sound if connected with blue tooth.

"I have bought and used many &#34;canned air&#34; for the primary reason of cleaning out my pc's every few months. From Dust off, Stoner, Ultra, and many others(most had bitterant). I used to think the brand did not matter, how could a compressed duster go wrong? Then I had the displeasure of using Endust.<br /><br />Problem 1: With this product I could not use it for 15 seconds before the horrid smell over took my room. I am writing this a hour later and I can still smell it lingering in the air.<br /><br />Problem 2: I used this on a dust filter and plastic trim that holds it in place. While it did get rid of some of the dust a greasy film developed over anything that was sprayed. This greasy substance transferred to anything around it, table, brush, cloth. Water alone and water with light soap had zero effect of removing it, Only thing that seemed to work was undiluted 99% isopropyl alcohol.",negative

"I have had these headphones, for coming up on two years now, and they still work as great as the day I opened them. They aren't any fancy smancy headphones. I mean be real they are only $20. There is some sound leakage if you have it up really loud, and they aren't the best at cancelling noise, but they never claimed to be! The bass and mid aren't bad either. After a few hours of use your head might be in some pain. You can't knock these headphones, because for the price they deliver great audio. AND they are super durable. They have dealt with my daily abuse, my cats playing with the wires, and my dogs stepping/sitting on them. If you are on a budget I RECOMMEND THESE A LOT. I was on a budget then, but now I'm going to upgrade. I am going to be keeping these though for back up.",positive

Piece of garbage. Poor color and image quality. Bought as an experiment and I am glad I didn't spend any more.,negative
I am very pleased with this purchase so far. It is about the size of my hand and the sound is phenomenal. I am amazed the price is so low. In years gone by I've purchased many speakers with lower sound quality but higher prices. Easy to pair right out of the box. Thinking of getting a couple more as gifts.,negative
"I bought this item because of all the great reviews, I was excited when it arrived. After I got it all hooked up and turned on the power display screen didn't come.

I hope I don't have any problems with it or I'll have to change to a different product.",positive
the product works and as not able to find something similar it's either this or nothing.  for a couple bucks more get the canopy protection plan as we've had to use it and TOTALLY worth it.  Easy to send back and replace under warranty.,negative

"This inexpensive rotor works perfectly. It is not hard to assemble, the instructions are intuitive and easy to understand. I honestly do not know how long this rotor will last? Some say for years, other reviewers are not so encouraging. I treated this rotor well, and carefully mounted it according to the instructions, pointed the antenna North, the wiring took 5 minutes. I have used it for over a month with a 6 meter Yagi (Ham) antenna.<br />The antenna has a 12 foot boom and 7 elements, it's pretty big - but the rotor works nicely and steady - it also points in the direction according to the settings on the control box. I did weather proof the bottom with rubberized coaxial tape but that may have been overkill, the rotor is on a 20 foot aluminum pole atop a roof and guyed. It works perfectly. No issues at all to this point. I did not give 5 stars only because there is a little play in the rotor itself once the mast/antenna are mounted. And the U bolts provided could have been more heavy duty - so I upgraded them myself.",positive
Unit had Left channel output intermittent dropout. Packed poorly for shipping. Sent unit back.,negative
"I bought this bulb for an Optima H31  for our second bulb replacement (yes we watch a LOT on the projector - no TV).  This is the same bulb model we had bought and installed before.  The bulb should slide into the opening very easily.  The metal shield on this bulb was either to long or not set properly and the only way we would have gotten it in would have been to force it into the slot which would have meant continuous pressure on the bulb and the projector (and since materials expand when they are hot, the pressure would have increased with use).  That pressure could have either damaged the projector or shortened the bulb life, risks we were not willing to take.  So it was returned.  We might have had a bad bulb or maybe this version of BL-FU200B just doesn't fit the H31.  The seller was excellent in working through this issue with us.",positive
worked great until it fell apart and i wasn't even gorilla style with the thing :/,positive
Bought these as a lower price alternative. They are not as good as glasses that manufacturers recommend nor as good as the higher priced alternatives. They do work if you do not care graphic they will be fine for you,positive
"Pros:<br />-paid 19$  and they work<br />-Bundled with different adapter help with fitting<br />-Paired easily with my Lg Flex and the amazon fire.<br />Cons<br />-Sound is crap, there is no bass and they remind me of dollar store earphones i bought once.<br />-they don't hold well while moving thus useless for me.<br />Conclusion<br />-they are bad overall and i wont recommend these to anyone.",negative
Sound was real good but the range was extremely short.  It would lose bluetooth connection at around 15 ft. I returned the unit.,positive
Why would anyone want a speaker that isn't any louder than their phone?,negative
"The headphones are okay.  I'd even go so far as to say good.  Problem is, Klipsch will not handle any warranty issues with this product since this isn't an authorized seller.  That means unless the seller (who hasn't responded) decides to somehow uphold the warranty, the 2 year parts and labor warranty is worthless, which means when it breaks (the controller did already, 1.5 years in) it will be the end of a set of headphones that isn't exactly cheap.",positive
"I really wanted to like this little clock.  Had to return it because the light is waaaay to bright to use in a bedroom.  At night it lights up the room.  I turned the dim setting on the lowest and still too bright.  Also, I was disappointed that the clock I received was green light, not blue. The instructions that came with it for setting the time and alarms, etc, took some thinking because it was obviously not written by someone who understands English very well... wish I could remember some of the funny translation, ...  had a good laugh.",positive

"earphones are fantastic, especially for someone who hates having to repeatedly stuff earbuds in their ears. These are great quality, last through everything (except accidentally leaving them in a pocket and running them through the wash) and still have very good sound quality.

"Myself and my young teen daughters love these phones.  They are not delicate, but I have to buy new ones after about a year because one side goes out intermittently.  I think the wires can't take much stretching; the kids spend a lot of time in bed with their electronics, and perhaps they tug on the wires.  My pair are fine until they get borrowed too many times.  They are really great phones for the price, ya just can't sleep with them.",positive
"After buying a turntable for the first time in a decade or two I pulled out my old records and borrowed a bunch of my dad's records.  It was amazing how many of them had ripped up paper sleeves that needed to be replaced.  I ordered up a batch of these and am pleased overall with them.  They do have a bit of static, but nothing crazy.  The LPs fit nicely inside and they are a whole lot better than old paper sleeves.<br /><br />Overall a pretty nice package of sleeves for the price.

"This is a nice little piece of equipment that has a lot going for it. It's small, well-made, looks good, sounds good, only uses 1.7 watts when it's idle (so you can leave it on 24/7 and not worry about it ruining the planet), and it gets 10 times louder than you would ever need for near-field use.<br /><br />One caveat is that it produces a small, constant amount of static. Even if you have the volume turned all the way down (and are thus not amplifying whatever small amount of analog noise is coming from your input source) you can still hear a small amount of static coming from your speakers' tweeters. You might have to move so your ear is only a couple inches away from a tweeter to hear it, but it's there. I don't think this would bother most people but if you have good hearing and you value absolute silence when working at your computer, it's kind of a bummer. That's my reason for deducting a star from an otherwise excellent product.pical bookshelf speaker is WAY more than enough for any residential application.",negative

The Brainwaves smoosh the music together, not much separation, and operate at a higher volume than the Rain, even when the player is operating at the same volume. (I plugged them into a Y-connector and switched buds back and forth.) The Rain earbuds have a wooden resonating chamber, which I like better than metal or plastic; it seems to give me more air around the individual instruments and voices.

"Save your money, I bought this on sale for $28 and wound up returning it the same day I received it, paid $6 to ship back, not worth keeping, I would rather receive the $22 net refund. I read so many great reviews, thought this must be an awesome little speaker. It is very well made, but once again, the only reason I buy speakers is for sound quality. I did not expect this to be equal to speakers costing $100, but I did expect it to be something special in its class. Maybe others giving great reviews are used to very cheap, low quality bluetooth speakers? The speaker appeared to be very well made, nice fit and finish, but the sound was tinny, weak, not enough volume, no punch, nothing special. I have the BEM Mobile speaker, it is much clearer, full sounding than t his unit. I also have the Sol Republic PUNK speaker, to me, this is the best &#34;extremely portable&#34; speaker currently available. Its flat, hockey puck shape makes it a no brainer to take anywhere. The sound out of the PUNK is actually pretty good considering its size. It has more &#34;presence&#34; and &#34;punch&#34; than other small bluetooth speakers. I picked up the Sol Republic PUNK at a big box store for about $45, very happy with it.",positive
"Truly a POS product. Has to be 1 of the only items that I've ever purchased that was 100% trash. Just a POS.

Much better than the other chargers I have purchased.,negative
Decent volume and range with linked device. Unfortunately loses connectivity from time to time and causes the song playing to skip about.,negative
I bought these to use with my in ear stage system. I was drawn in by the brand because I use an AT mic. These are OK for mp3 at best but worthless for on stage use. Very tinny with no low end.

The little metal cover on the ear bud fell off after 2 months.,positive
"Bought this lamp as a replacement for my JVC HD-56G786 TV because the one that was in the TV was going dark. I bought the lamp and the screws didn't quite reach the housing (only one side was actually able to reach after messing with it) and the picture still comes in dark... darker than the old lamp, in fact. I triple checked to make sure that this was the correct product for my TV and it was labeled correctly... It's just an inferior product. Don't try to short cut the simple fix on your TV and buy a $90 part for $30... you'll get what you pay for.",positive
"Upscales as expected, but has a problem scaling sound properly. Anytime you pause the game or the music changes the volume gets very loud then lowers back to where it should be.",negative
"Works as advertised however, the micro hdmi end is EXTREMELY tight when plugging and unplugging. I use this for working on microcontrollers that are fitted with a micro hdmi, and since they are usually just soldered on the side of the board, I have to very carefully wiggle the end in and out of the socket. Not sure if this is a usual thing or a manufacturers tolerances issue. Still works though.",negative
I havent had cable TV for over 3 years and have a roof top antenna I use on the TV in my living room. I thought it would be nice to have TV in my bedroom and so bought this Antenna for that TV. I get NO reception of even one channel. I will call the number included with the instruction page to see if I can get help... but so far this is a waste of money. I bought it after reading the positive reviews.,positive
I've been using APC for several years. I do not use the computer software. I use the Battery Backup outlets only for critical equipment and the Surge Protected outlets for other support equipment. When power outage occurs and it starts BEEPING it gives me plenty of time to properly power down the critical gear. Yes the batteries will lose strength and eventually die completely after a few years so if you are in question a good test is to connect (only) a couple 100 watt lights and pull the plug.<br />Been considering using a couple old units (with bad batteries) connected to a large 12 volt battery as an emergency Inverter (after I disable the beepers).,positive
Thing just does not work at all. Could not get sound out of it no matter how hard I tried. Documentation is pretty bad. I am going to send it back.,negative
"This item did not work on my 2014 Audi, just kept saying connecting but wouldn't play music. Sucks it didn't work.",positive
"This cable is a tank. Be very cautious how you connect this beast. The weight of the cable puts a HUGE strain on the connector. It is obviously durable and well made, perhaps too well made. There is no way an HDMI connector can sustain the weight of this cable over any significant amount of time. Make sure you take the weight off the connector somehow.",positive
Good rechargeable Panasonic is a brand you can trust and I have used a lot of different rechargeable batteries but these are always the best,positive
"This is a great product, I use while I'm in the shower, I place on a rack on top of the toilet seat, so when I reach from the shower with wet hands to change the song, the speaker doesn't get ruined. The sound quality is good, and it goes up pretty high. The battery life is ok. I do recommend it if you're going to be around water. I received this product for a discount or for free in exchange of an honest and unbiased review.",positive
"Great sounding headphones for electronic based music; hip-hop, dubstep, house, dnb, etc. These are not DJ quality, nor would I recommend them for DJing. I purchased them for the gym and they work well. They're not bulky and stay on during all activity; cardio, HIIT, lifting, jumping, ect.",positive

"Product was okay.  Sound is good, but quality is poor.  It broke after a couple of weeks.  :(",negative
"It does fit my 32&#34; flat screen tv, the only issue was the swivel was not long enough!! I don't believe there was a measurement of the length of the swivel. I kept it anyways because returning it would waste a lot of time!!",positive
"Pros:<br />Great form factor. Lightweight. Charger is a standard micro USB, not a proprietary port. I liked that it sat comfortably in my ear canal without needing a plastic loop around the outer ear. Syncing was no problem on Android or Apple devices.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The only thing that disappointed about this product was the sound quality of incoming calls. Voices sounded muddled and difficult to discern. To thoroughly test the device, I tried different combinations of smartphones, locations / cell signals, callers, and even played music through it. The results were similar: as if sounds were being filtered through a thin pillow. Most people I called commented that they could hear my words clearly, but that my voice was a little quiet.<br /><br />Alternate suggestion:<br />My baseline for comparison is the Plantronics Voyager Edge which I've had for 6 months.  It is about half the price of this Bose headset and is a comparatively older design.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JLVNF2O I was hoping to ditch the Edge's microphone boom arm and ear loop, but I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that can match it for call quality. Sound is superb on both ends...mine and the caller's.  Voice clarity is excellent, and it does an exceptional job of blocking background noises (the exception being high winds).  No surprise that The Sweethome (a leading product review website...google it) named the Voyager Edge their top pick.",positive
Superior reception.  Better than my 150 dollar Radio Shack antenna.,positive
"Great, I hooked it up with Bose speakers and it's sound was very good for my Large backyard. Bluetooth wAs easy to cpnnect",positive
It did not work properly. Returned and received refund.,positive
a gift. but super cute from what I can tell. my daughter will be thrilled. STOCKING STUFFER :),positive
The suction cup broke when I took it out of the package.,positive
"It is a convenient radio and easy to operate.  It's plenty loud enough for the application. The digital clock is too small to read while in the shower. The sound is tinny, but then it is a very small water resistant speaker.  The tuner is not very sensitive.  It only picks up strong stations and in a metropolitan area the stations run together.  Overall it looks good, works well on local, strong, stations, is loud enough, and hangs almost anywhere.  For the price, it does the job OK.",positive
"I ordered this remote as a replacement remote for my daughters room. When I got it, it was covered in dirt and was sticky. I'm pretty sure I got it new and it didn't look new.",positive
Great buy!! Local repair shop wanted $200 for this part + installation. Very easy to install - we were up & running in minutes - literally!!!,positive
Works the first couple times but just stopped after about a week. NEVER Buy these if you want to keep you device charged,positive
"Works well and the swivel outlets are nice, but it starts to fall off the wall when using adapters or plugging in 4+ three prong power cords.",negative
I am happy with the stand the only issue I have is its hard to plug in additional equipment because the frame in the back cover some of the  outlets in the rear.,positive
"Alittle sparse on directions.I didn't have any problem, but for anyone not familiar with &#34;wood frame construction&#34; it could cause a safety hazzard.",negative
"Product is older version and the tape is black instead of white in the back.  Does not print as dark as the original tape which came with my model, but did work, so that I'm happy about.  The quality was not as rich and vibrant, which leads me to post a not stellar review.  But good price and availability for a discontinued product so can't complain too much.",positive
Nice Bluetooth  speaker but battery life is HORRIBLE,positive
"Really like the product, howver it came in an open bag like it was used, and with only one ear bud covering.",negative
"The microphone does not work through this plug, and the dial tone and ringing sounds are very distorted.  If you expect to use this to convert a headset that works with 1/8&#34; (3.5mm) phone jacks and have it work with a phone that only accepts 2.5mm plugs, look elsewhere.  It only passes the earphone signals TO you, not your spoken voice through the microphone.  And there's something wrong even with the audio received through this.  Thank you Amazon for a wonderful return/refund policy!<br /><br />(Note: I'm using a Panasonic KX-TG76xx series phone.)",negative
"The zipper transfers every scrape, bump and rustle right into your ear. This makes them almost unusable while walking.",positive
"Well made but underpowered. The battery ran down in just over an hour, and the volume needs to be louder. The Bluetooth works very well and it is well made - Increase battery life and volume and you will have yourself a nice piece of gear.",negative
These fit perfectly and fired up correctly.  I bought 2 to be sure that I could test for a bad bulb.  I now have 2 on the shelf ready when needed.,negative
I bought this item and it worked for 1 minute then stopped.,positive

can't turn the volume up high enough when listening to music on the mower,negative
I ordered 3 pairs. 2 of the three were defective. They responded very quickly to all emails and sent me 2 new pair while allowing me to keep the defective two. The working pair has been great and I am very satisfied.,positive
Was not working out of the box. One side worked while the other did not. Ended up returning it for a different brand. My niece was disappointed as this was a Christmas gift at the time.,negative
"Not as good as the original remote, the okay button feels like a old IBM mechanical keyboard vs. todays chiclet style keys.",positive
"The original remote wasn't even a year old and it stopped working.  I got online to check to see if other people were having the same problem and there were many. I wasn't happy about the price of the replacement remote, but what are you going to do... you need it.",negative
"I did nothing.. however in all fairness is could be a problem with the VHS part of the unit. I have a combo CDR, player and VHS machine.",negative
"VCR/DVD may work, but PC video output looks horrible.  My HDTV's HDMI ports went out (on a 42&#34; LG HDTV) and I needed a way to hook to our family computer that we used for Minecraft / Movies / Web browsing / etc.  I tried two different computers connected at 720dpi and both looked so bad it hurt my eyes to read what was on the screen.  I think maybe the 720dpi or 1080dpi has to be reduced to 480i for the analog AV signal, but whatever the reason, it is not acceptable for me.  I was deceived by all the great comments, and in the Q&A, someone asked &#34;If the input via HDMI is 1080p, what is the output resolution?&#34;.  Pioneer Marketing, who sells the item, answers &#34;The device has 2 options, 1 is 1080p, the other is 720p. So it is up to you to choose.&#34;  Found out that was wrong information - my device had no options/switches/etc to change the &#34;output&#34;, and I found the NTSC format is fixed at 480 interlaced lines, so how can you get 720 or 1080 pixels output when the format is fixed at 480?  One of my pictures shows my laptop native resolution next to the TV, and clarity is not even comparable.  Sure, you can probably make out an icon at 6 feet away, but try reading a web page, or any text for that matter without straining yourself.  I actually found out after ordering this device, that my HDTV has an Audio 3.5mm input jack in the back (I thought it was some kind of DVI/digital audio connection) but turns out all I needed was a VGA cable and the 3.5mm audio cable hooked up. Now it's back like it was when HDMI was working.  I returned this converter.",positive
"does what it says in the description.  No More, No Less.",negative
"Do not buy this! it is a scam, doesn't work on or with anything at all. Waste of 5 bucks, would really like a refund. 0/5 if that was an option.",negative
Nifty little piece that does a good job of upping sound quality from all sources.,positive
I bought these as a gift. They came in just the way I wanted them. Thank you very much.,negative
Took weeks to arrive. Didn't work out of the box. Provider refunded me two dollars. 10/10 would not buy again.,negative
"The previous bulb, a cheapo from Mexico and bought through Amazon lasted exactly fourteen days and seemed underpowered as the tv image would take a long time to appear. This Philips, NOT a cheapo, is faster and so far, thirteen days, all is good. Time will tell.",positive
"Bought for two different locations-only picked -up 3 stations in Iowa City,picked-up about 15 in orlando",positive
What I don't prefer about it pales to the price I paid for it!  But I do wish the light that glows from it would dissipate when not in use.  My solution is to keep it tucked behind everything.,positive
So I'm guessing that this item that was over $800 at the time of purchase should last more than two years. Onkyo used to be a great product.  Very disappointed in this.  Totally stopped working after just under 2 years of being in operation.,positive
"Up until the speakers go out on you, this is just an ok product.",negative
"Out of 6 batteries used over about 6 weeks, 2 are already dead and will no longer recharge! 😳😁 Not a happy camper!!",positive
"For the price, the sound is great. Yes, the cords do give a lot of 'feedback ' when they rub together but, if you sit at a desk all day like me then it shouldn't be an issue. They really are noise cancelling too so your music is loud and clear. My coworkers have to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention these work so well. Lol",positive
"Worked great, initially. I've had it for less than 2 months and the cord has already frayed and will no longer charge my Kindle.",positive
"Not Bad product...But I AM DISSAPPOINTED WITH MY AMAZON CREDIT CARD. INTEREST IS TO HIGh,from syncronity Bank...I have good credit.....Need a bettet rate of interest.Thank You.",negative
LOVE This center channel speaker.  Whey they don't sell this one in the US is beyond me.  Fits right in front of the TV and disappears while putting out incredible sound.,positive
I like the sound but it doesn't hold a charge well.,negative
I received the email about the products in which I purchased,negative
"I bought these at Best Buy and then returned them the next day.<br /><br />I would say the sound quality is good, maybe slightly better that the ear buds that come with an iPhone or iPod. They are loud enough. They fit snug and would be great for running, biking, or general gym exercises. I do boot camp classes at the gym and would be confident in wearing them there. They are not noise canceling which is good for running or biking on the street with cars around.<br /><br />Once they're connected (I have an iPhone 6) you need to keep them with you. Walk several feet away and the signal starts struggle to stay connected. This is not a huge deal for me. They hurt my ears a lot, but I might have been able to fix that a little bit if I put on different tips.<br /><br />When I noticed the weak Bluetooth connection with these ear buds I started to do a bit if online reading. It seems these ear buds are fragile and do not hold up to even general use. Many people report the inline remote failing, either falling apart or falling because of sweat. The other part that seems to regularly fail is the battery, or its ability to charge and hold a charge. I decided to return them and not deal with all this headache.<br /><br />When I walked back into Best Buy with the headphones, the employee said &#34;yup, I see 10-15 of these come back a day. That's why we don't offer any kind of coverage for them&#34;. That number seems high, but they obviously see a lot of these ear buds come back.<br /><br />I really wanted these to work. I have had a hard time trying to find something that will meet my needs and these ear buds would have been great if they weren't so fragile.",positive
Light and comfortable to wear.  I use them with my iPad in Monaural mode as I have hearing in only one ear.,positive
"You get what you buy. I spent barely 30 dollars on a 64gb media player which is ridiculously cheap, and as it turns out it is cheap for a reason. Don't get me wrong it gets the job done since all I need is something to play for commutes. However this is very cheaply made with terrible software and even the hardware wasnt connected properly to the diagrams of the instructions. UI is unfriendly and the play system itself allows for frustration with use. I prefered my old 8gb walkman but that broke and I didn't feel like spending 70 bucks. This is priced cheap because its made cheap but overall it gets the job done and at the end of the day that's all that matters on a budget. 2/5 hardware, 1/5 software, 3/5 music quality. 2/5 functionality. So 2/5 overall.",negative
"The IML technology is something I had never experienced before and I'm blown away. The picture is inlaid in the plastic so there are no stickers or overlays. I kept looking at the plastic looking for a start or stop point and there isn't one, it's smooth and sleek. Very well done.",positive
"Although I much prefer over the ear headphones, there are times the portability and convenience of lightweight ear buds can't be beat. Unfortunately comfort and overall sound quality are usually issues. These inexpensive headphones address comfort concerns by including ear caps in three different sizes. The caps are made of silicone which is soft and does mold to the ear. I liked the white and gold. It made them bright and easy to find in a cluttered bag or backpack. Although the sound quality is far from philharmonic, it is more than adequate for headphones at this price point. It is crisp and clean with no overpowering bass. The inline mic works well  and contributes to the convenience factor. Overall I liked both the look and the performance of these affordable in ear headphones.",negative
The buttons work but there is noticeable quality loss in the music.  It is also labeled with Monster branding which is false.  I replaced this with a V-Moda SpeakEasy cable and couldn't be happier.,positive
I bought these a couple weeks ago and sent them back two days later. The sound quality is comparable to that of my Apple earbuds but I was looking for something better. Also I felt ridiculous wearing these headphones because of all the unnecessary padding. These headphones are nothing to write home about. Do yourself a favor and invest in higher quality headphones.,negative
"Let me start by saying that they're great for 25 bucks. But there isn't enough bass response for my taste. I would've paid a little extra for some bigger magnets in these. There IS SOME BASS but not enough for my liking. If you're into reggae or hip-hop, pass on these and pay extra on some better ones.",positive
Didnt work for what i needed it for. its not very clear on what exactly it works with,positive
"Worked great for six months, then the two of the HDMIs started to go intermittent. Have to send back to a repair center. Apparently a common problem with most a/v receivers.",positive
Worked for about 1 month then quit on me. I would not buy this cord,positive
"Great sound, nice strong cord, right angle plug is very convenient. Microphone is a little close to the earpiece and I'm seeming to have trouble disconnecting a call with one click. There may be an intermittent break in voice communications, but it may be my case not letting the plug engage snugly. We'll see, but it's great so far.",positive
Everything was good except for the Cassette Player portion. The speakers would not go loud enough to hear very well when you played a cassette tape.  Radio and Cd and &#34;audio-in&#34; all worked fine.,positive
"Does not pair readily and when it does, tends to kick off after a short time. Noticeable degradation in sound quality and volume as well.",positive
"For the price compared to other similar products, I'm underwhelmed with this. I can't skip, the buttons are difficult to read, it doesn't get very loud and lacks bass response. I'm shopping for other brands.",negative
Headphones so tightly coiled they would have been a vice on my child's head. Returned.,negative
"The engineers at SunLabz should buy a set of calipers.  These batteries function well, but they are just a little bit bigger than your industry standard batteries which, on some devices, makes them hard to get fully seated in the battery compartment - and then just as difficult to take them out for recharging.  It makes no sense that something seemingly this simple isn't quality checked better.  I'll still use them, but I'm going to be ordering a set from a different manufacturer to see if I can find a battery that fits like every other off the shelf AA.",negative
This radio is way better than our old one.  Dials are smoother and many more to program.  CD player works great.,positive
They're OK. I saw the review by an Amazon/CNET editor about top headphones under $50. I like the fact it has adjustable buds.  I'm not an audiophile but just know you're getting what you pay for. For $10 it's a good deal.,positive
"Lovely, rich sound. Easy to set up and use. I love the button controls on top. And you can use it as an external speaker and mic for your cell phone (if it has bluetooth). My only complaint is that you can only pair one device to it at a time. That's disappointing. Might have to buy another one for that.",positive
"These earbuds are very comfortable and well made. The flat wire also makes them much less prone to tangling. While the reviews suggest a very impressive sound quality I found them to be... mediocre. Yes, there is a moderately good lower end response, but it isn't a thumping bass...even for earbuds. Unfortunately, the lower end mixes with the mid/high and you end up with a mediocre balance. If you do not have the ability to use some type of equalizer or mode setting, you will get a pretty middle of the road experience and sound. That said, for $15 these are a good deal and will hold up to abuse.",positive
"Good mid-price range wireless headphones. I can move around my one bedroom apartment and still receive a clear signal. It was easy to sync to my devices and very comfortable. I haven't had a need to use the aux cable yet so can't give a review on that, except for the cable being short, but there are plenty of aux cables you can buy should you need it to be longer. Four stars because if I have any app on my computer open when disconnecting the headphones, it crashes that app.",positive
"Just a very bad product. I bought 3. 1 DOA, another worked for few times then joined the other. Only one still working, but whenever I stopped the music from the phone a huge buzzing noise will follow, until the music is played again. It is cheap, and it is really a cheap piece of junk.",negative
I've had it for a few months now and only one port works so 1 star complete crap don't waist your money,negative
"Love this clock with ceiling display.  Easy to read in the dark.  Some said it was  too bright but I don't agree.  Compared to a dark room, it is bright, but has the options to dim to lower levels.  No need for dimmer sheet.",positive
"Received these headphones today, so my review only reflects the first days use. If there are any additional comments about these headphones, I will update.<br />After unboxing and turning on the power of the headphones a red light appeared. Following instructions, I charged the headphones off of my computer for about one hour until a blue light appeared. It is a bit difficult to determine if the headphones are on or off.<br />The headphones quickly paired to both my Iphone 6 and Ipad mini.<br />You can control the volume either off of your device or from the headphones.<br />The headphone are comfortable against my ears, however, the center of the headphones rub against the crown of my head. I don't believe my head is larger then the average size man. A female might not have the same issue. It might be a problem for me when using the phones for long periods.<br />I also used the headphones while calling on my Iphone 6 and it works very well.<br />I did not notice any outside noise reduction while wearing these headphones.<br />I will use them primarily at the beach, where I won't worry about something happening to them because they cost me  under $22.00",negative
I thought it would be a little louder and the battery would last longer other than that I like it,positive
"Was looking for a good speaker for my deck.  It had good bass but sound was low.  Music wouldn't carry across pool to other side of the deck.  I really liked the design, battery life, and overall functionality of it.  It sounds great inside, but outside just didn't work for me.  I ended up sending back and getting the better and louder ue boom.",positive
"They are absolutely not original ,and the sound quality is pretty poor and not worth for the price .",negative
"good batteries but misleading description.  &#34;Pre-charged and prepared to use out of the pack&#34;.... Not even close!  most of the batteries I have purchased have been 25% or less.  I have a digital charger and it requires the batteries to have a slight charge on them or they won't charge. Some were so dead that they would not charge on my charger.  I used a RC battery charger to shock them back to life and then my digital charger would see them and cycle them just fine but I should not have had to do that with fully charged batteries.  Once they are fully charged they seem to hold a charge very well, its been over a month and when I tested them they are still fully charged while in storage.  Overall great battery but lost a star because of misleading advertising, also like I had said totally dead batteries was a problem I could overcome but some people may not.",negative

"The product you need to buy quite often to keep your SOL Republic headphones working.  So, this is low quality, expensive cable. This is a second wire I had to change on my SOL Republic Tracks headphones this year.",positive
Very cutie. Sound quality is great and very durable. They stopped working on one side after 6 months. All in all a good buy.,positive
"I got these because I was being sent around the country for business and my ears were getting sore from my cheap earbuds and I couldn't hear anything over the engines unless I turned them up all the way.<br /><br />The Sony's do a decent job at cancelling out steady low end noise significantly. You can still tell you're on an airplane but its less noisy and quiter in general. They don't cancel the engine noise completely and the crying baby will still wake you up, but it's better than nothing and does a pretty good job for $30.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is comfort. These feel too pressed against my ears. The pads don't do their job and after a 6 hour flight my ears were sore again, but around the edges this time. Maybe I just have big ears.",positive
"OK sound for cheap earbuds, but the dreaded sound-from-one-side damage came six months later. I suspect it's from a twist in the cord near the plug. If you have a tip on how to correct that, let me know. I won't be buying these again.",positive
A little pricey for some little bits of rubber but they do the job. Just what I needed.,positive
"The bluetooth receiver unit died in less than a year. It was seldom used, abused, or place in harsh environments. Mostly used in an air conditioned building. Because AAA batteries have only 1/3 the power of AA batteries, it eats batteries like crazy too (compared to most portable speakers). But long before the batteries die, when they get just a little weak so the voltage is just a little low, the sound is real distorted if you play it louder than a whisper. At full voltage they sound good for their size. The bad is rechargeable batteries are already lower in voltage when fully charged than alkaline batteries. Rechargeable, 1.2-1.25 volts each. Alkaline, 1.5-1.6 volts each. So when you use rechargeable cells, it don't take long before the voltage is low enough to cause distortion a normal volumes. Since the bluetooth failed, & it's not practical to use batteries, I dug up an old usb adapter jack that fits the power jack in the back of the speaker. So I power it with my laptop's USB, & use it for my laptop speakers. All is well using that way. I got mine on sale years ago for around 30 bucks. Even if the blutooth still worked, I don't think it is worth much more.",positive
Polk never disappoints. I purchased a second one for my daughter's car and she loved it.,positive
broke after two weeks. Contacting the seller soon to see what can be done.,positive
"I only use Cable Matters, Mediabridge, and Amazon cables. These are the quality I prefer to use, high quality cables. I have yet to have a short, lose the screw in knobs, or loose connections with these. Picture quality too is amazing.",positive
"I thought the speaker was bigger than what it is. It's small and wasn't what I expected . On the picture it wasn't small &&'d when I read about it it never said it was small . Length wise I thought it was longer , that's the only reason I got it .",positive

Only had to get a second replacement. The second works well. The replacement came immediately when ordered.,positive
GREAT SOUND!!!! Bluetooth works for a couple songs and starts to crackle after that. Tried moving it around all 12 times while testing and fully charging and shutting both phone and speaker off etc. Straight headphone wire works great but since ports are open you no longer have water proof ability.,positive
Not ideal for Bose 3.2.1 because of its wire placement. Should be perfect for many others.,positive
"Good sound  and well made....however, reception from source ( pc in my case)  reduces quickly from as little as 6-7 feet.away.",positive
"Bought mine in june 2013,  I received all of the assessories which is good because it does not work on battery power at all.  It does not charge up at all.  Syllabe never responded to my email asking for help.  I does work very well with the USB plugged in for power and with the mic jack.  The blue tooth is worthless.  $125.00 wasted.  Aint nothing like the real thing.  I will get beats when I get the courage to buy a nice pair of head phones.",positive
"I don't really write reviews, but after having purchased a set of these speakers from a retail store on clearance for $13, I was utterly disappointed.  They are total, absolute, 100% garbage. My cell phone plays noticeably louder than the 'good' speaker, and the other one you can't hear unless it's at max volume and you're within like 2 feet of it in a quiet room.  Don't waste your money on these. Maybe the other people got a better set, but the set I have are completely worthless.

"Since they were priced right, I bought three of these lamps for my TV. (2 spares)<br />I didn't have good luck with them.<br />First one didn't last an hour, 2nd one lasted 3 weeks and started flickering then went out.<br />I didn't even try the 3rd one, I figured it would not work either.<br />I ended up going to local Appliance store and buying an OEM lamp from Mitsubishi.<br />Luckily, I still have time to return them.",positive

"These sound good but pairing them up can be tricky.  I have accidentally called people when I was just trying to get the headphones to work.  Now I put my phone in airplane mode to pair them up so I don't accidentally call someone, then pair them, then take my phone off airplane mode.  It's aggravating but I would still like them well enough except for the excruciating ear pain they cause!  They flatten my ears and at first, it is just a mild discomfort but after 30-60 minutes, it is intolerable.  Once I fell asleep with them on and woke up a few hours later with horrible pain!  These really really hurt me and my 12 year old son (sadly, we bought two pairs).  Really disappointing and I wish I had returned them when I could.",positive
"Don't buy these connectors. They are almost impossible to disconnect once you put them together. It is better to pay a little extra for the real deans. I got them for airsoft, but either way do not get  these connectors. I doubt that it was just a defect because all 10 of the connectors had the same results.",positive
"I'm no audiophile but I appreciate nice sound. The bass is pronounced enough without overpowering all other parts of the music you might be listening to. A very enjoyable listening experience.<br /><br />The M-100s come with two detachable cables. One cable can be used for sharing and the other has a mic for calls, I guess. Cables are tangle free.<br /><br />Solid construction with a case that allows me to throw them in my bag worry free.",positive
"These are by far my favorite earbud headphones. The sound is phenomenal and far superior to other earbuds I've tried, which include a few Bose, Sennheiser, and Sonys. In fact, I like the sound out of these more compared to a few mid level on-ear and over-the-ear headphones I've tried. The carrying case and ear-bud sizes provided are helpful as well. One thing to consider though: these are not sport headphones and are not meant to be worn if you are being active. The movement of the wires travel up the headphones -- kind of like if you tap on the outside of the headphones while you wear them. It's only a minor annoyance.",positive
"Great for practicing late at night or when people around you think your guitar playing sucks. It's not very loud and has no volume controls. I use it with a Koss KTXPRO1 which has a volume control like most headphones do.<br /><br />This unit is great for guitars that plug in at the front ( like a Strat ) and guitars that plug in at the bottom ( like Gibsons etc). The reason for this is that since it has no controls for you to look at or fiddle with, it won't matter where on the guitar its plugged into. You just plug your headphones to it, plug it into your guitar and away you go. Simple.<br /><br /> If you need to blow your eardrums out, then something like the Andoer Flanger Mini Headphone amp is for you. I got one too and its loud, less money and has more controls.<br /><br />I don't like to use the flanger on my Gibson because the jack is on the bottom of the guitar and with this thing sticking out of it out of sight, you can bump into some thing and break it. With this Bravo headplug  mini amp, protrusion from the guitar is less of a problem. Both are a lot of fun.",positive
"First off these earbuds are great for the price.  They have decent sound and a good battery life.  My one and only critique of these is that they need to work on the firmware integration with iPhones.  I can use the microphone to use siri or to record my voice, but if you answer a phone call or make a phone call you can't use the headphone mic.  Other than the mic issue these have great bang for their buck.  I would still buy these even without the mic.  So if a microphone is a necessity you may want to look elsewhere.",positive
All hardware included. Great Product at great price. Swivels and tilts.,positive
Excellent value for the price especially if you can also grab it on sale. I havnt had to test water proofing yet but the audio quality is good. It doesn't however have buttons to skip or skip back a song only to change volume and Bluetooth controls,positive
I was looking for an adapter that would allow me to re-position my Chromecast which sticks out the side of my Samsung TV. This adapter seemed to be exactly what I needed - compact and flexible. The only problem is that introduces a lot of noise into any video that is ported thru it. The noise is sufficient enough that I couldn't use it. I contacted the seller but they have made no effort to address the issue or replace their product. They simply responded that they were looking into it. I cannot comment as to whether all of these adapters will introduce noise since I have only one adapter but my adapter is proof that the manufacturer's quality control is lacking.,negative
"This device didn't really live up to its positive reviews for me. I used this in a home that needed to stream music from a further distance than Bluetooth could handle. After setting it up on the existing wifi network, it disconnected often and had unacceptable cutting in and out of audio. Only by connecting to its own wifi network was it possible to get anything from this device. If you aren't setting this thing up in a one room apartment where your router, phone and aLLreli are in close proximity, don't expect much freedom. I opted for the older airport express.",positive
"I was a little disillusioned with these headphones. On paper (or on monitor, rather) they looked great. On sale, decent company, iOS compatible, what's not to like?!<br /><br />A few things going on with these. And for the record, they aren't bad enough that I'd like to return them, just not what I was hoping for:<br />1. They are MUCH bulkier than they appear in the photos. The flat cables are wider than you would expect, about 3/4 of a centimeter. They also just take up a lot of space in your pocket when you roll them up in between use.<br />2. The controller is bulky and just a flush cylinder for the most part, nothing concave to get situated with only by touch except for the center orange button which slightly protrudes from the casing. The buttons are also kinda &#34;wimpy&#34;, just light to the touch and sensitive.<br />3. The other day the volume controls stopped working. I plugged in the apple earbuds, and controls on that worked fine. So I restarted my phone and then the volume started working again. Might have been a phone issue, but figured I'd mention it here.<br />4. In terms of audio, everything seems ok. I've never been good at telling when the sound is good or not, but if definitely gets loud. Sometimes if it's in your ear at a weird angle you lose some of the bass, but that might just be a weirdly shaped earhole issue.<br /><br />All in all, I'd go with something a bit more substantial. Don't think you're getting a deal here, you certainly get what you paid for, and if you have an iPhone you're probably better off with the earbuds that come with the phone.",negative
Came quickly and was very easy to install and is working good. Glad I ordered it,positive
"This works well with my Roku3 (and is certainly easier to find!). I took off one star only because the housing tooling is not up to the same level as the Roku original (but still satisfactory). Also, no batteries were included. It runs off AAA batteries rather than the original's AA batteries. But then what do you expect for $12?  The &#34;OK&#34; button is in the middle of the arrow keys rather than a separate location which actually makes more sense.<br /><br />Just find two AAA batteries and it works just fine without any further setup.",positive
"Good sound, but play button on the speaker does not work.",positive
"Used these during our trip to Italy.  The diameter of the pins was too big to fit the small round pin-only receptacles.  They did fit into the outlets that accepted multiple terminal shapes - each hotel room had at least one of this type so we got by.  When they fit the receptable, they worked fine.",negative
"I wanted to upgrade from a cheap pair of Denon in-ears I bought for $30 in a bind.  The headset I was looking for had to be in-ear, have bluetooth connectivity, active noise cancellation, and cost less than a hundred dollars.  The Phiaton fit all those requirements.  The set comes with a wired connection, mini usb charging cables, and various sized ear pieces.  I found the medium sized rubber ear pieces to be the most comfortable, I can usually shove a large foam ear piece in my ears like with the Shure IEMs I use when I'm playing music, but these foam pieces (only comes with one size) were down right uncomfortable for my ear size.  Setup was relatively easy once I realized there was an on/off for the bluetooth, on/off for the ANC, and a phone button (I intuitively thought holding down on the phone button would turn on the device and could've save some time if I just looked at the manual).<br />1. The Active Noise Cancellation- Pretty mediocre.  This is not a &#34;suck the air out of your ear&#34; noise canceller.  Rather it mutes a small spectrum of droning hum, that when you listen to music at a comfortable volume, you can't even tell if it's on or off.  I think the headset would perform better if it isolated sound as well as cancelled, but I was not able to get isolation even with a nice tight seal.  Because of this, the Phiaton with ANC on was no better than my sound isolating Denons.  So it's a wash with my Denons and in fact a step down if I turn ANC off.<br />1a. If you are wanting noise cancelling for the airplane you may want to consider something else.  Like I said regarding noise isolation, this headset does a poor job.  I could hear the conversations behind me, the flight attend and pilot on the intercom, my Denons can block all those noises out.  It did cancel out the engine noise okay, but no better than the Denons.<br />1b. I wore these at a busy restaurant and at a Starbucks and the ANC seemed to work much better in these type of situations than on an airplane, but once again, not much better than my Denons.  I can say though, the benefit of ANC over a noise isolator is you don't hear your feet when you walk or the cords when they bump up against your shirt.<br />2. Sound quality- Highs are crisp, mids are present, lows are not punchy enough.  I only wear in-ears and come to expect bass to be less than over the ear headphones, but this is weak even for in-ears.  It's a clean sound and it is acceptable, but don't expect to be wowed with audio fidelity.  One note, I was thinking how weak the volume was when I was trying to control the volume on my iPad.  I forgot that there is a volume control on your dongle, you can crank that up all the way if you like to control the volume on your device or vice versa.<br />3. Bluetooth connection- Pretty standard setup.  Turn on headset, hold the phone button down, look for the headset on your bluetooth menu, and connect.  Simple, no issues.  You get a tiny buzzing sound once you connect to the bluetooth, but it seems to disappear when the audio is playing.<br />4. Build Quality- As the other reviewers state, the dongle is made of plastic, but I like it this way as it keeps the dongle lightweight.  I clip it on my shirt and forget it's there.  The clip is plastic, but it seems solid.  The access panel on the bottom is easy to access for wired connection and charging.  Overall I think it's a nice design and I have no issues with it except perhaps they can make it smaller.<br />5. Telephone- People on the receiving end say they have trouble hearing me when I'm in a noisy location, so I don't know if the mic is noise cancelling or not.  No issues with calls using the headset in a quiet area.<br />Overall, I think it's slightly overpriced at it's current price of $67 and I know it used to retail for twice as much as it is currently.  The bottom line is, this headset isn't for everyone, in fact you might be better off paying for a cheaper bluetooth in-ear sound isolater without the ANC as it would get you the same results.  Also, I would test these out if you can before you buy.  PROS: Wireless, portable, solid wireless Bluetooth connection, quite comfortable once you pick the right ear pieces.  Cons: Mediocre ANC, mediocre sound",negative

"Belkin absolutely missed the mark with the design of this product.  There is a switch on the side that selects the time out to turn off at 1/2 hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours.  On the top is a push button to turn on the timer but the problem is that there is NO WAY to turn it off before the timer expires.  The operations manual says &#34;to turn off, unplug the device from the power&#34;  That is crazy, it should be able to turn ON and OFF with the switch!",negative

This was the cheapest deal for 90 min tapes at 45 count. I dont need super high fidelity.",negative
"I bought these for a month long trip to Switzerland. When used with a non-recessed outlet they serve their purpose amicably. However,  these adapters DO NOT fit in recessed Swiss outlets.<br /><br />I was able to use them in a recessed outlet only after spending about half an hour on each adapter whittling extraneous plastic off the sides with my, admittedly dull, pocket knife. Once whittled to a usable shape, they again served their purpose well.",negative

"Update 12/31/15: After having this for several months now, I've been noticing a lot of random shut downs. It would play fine for a few minutes, but then just turns itself off with the on/off switch still on. When this happens I just have to flip it back off and then on again and it would work. This happens infrequently, sometimes it plays just fine for however long I have it going. When this problem does occur though, it's just annoying.  Update 9/3/15: The company managed to finally get back in touch with me and they were completely professional about the whole situation. Seems like customer service is one of their top priories, and they replaced my defective device hassled free. Correspondence was easy and the shipment was fast as well. Again, I really did like these speakers it's just unfortunate that some how a defective one came into my possession. Still loving the amazing sound quality for the price that I paid. Even with all the hassle of getting a new device, they deserve a 5/5 on their customer service alone.  I bought this over a month ago and it was really amazing for the price. The bass, mids, and highs were really good when comparing it to the quality to price ratio.  With that being said though, just a few weeks ago I ran out of batteries while using it. I turned it off and plugged it in to charge over night. When I woke up for work, I unplugged it and just left it on my desk. Later in the evening, I went to turn it on but the usual blue light that turns on did not and the usual sound that it would make when turning it on did not come on either. I thought I didn't charge it or something, but when I plugged it up again the back light that shows that it is charge would turn on for a few seconds and then turned off again. This means that it is fully charged. The weird thing is that I was still able to connect to it through bluetooth on my phone (which is the on device that I use to pair with this speaker). I can see the device on my phone, the battery shown on my phone for the device was fully charge. I tried playing some music from my phone and again, nothing was coming out of the speakers at all. Nothing I tried seemed to work, again the only thing that works is the charging light from the back and the ability to connect through bluetooth. I tried to contact the manufacturer (MSSV) through their official website and left a few messages for them. Their website stated that once I submit the request, allow them 1-2 business days and they will get back to me. It's been almost 2 weeks and I've yet to received anything from them.  All in all, it really is a good device. Just hope that you're not unlucky like me and get a defective one because you'll basically be stuck with a bluetooth paper weight.",positive
"The projected time onto the ceiling is great, but it loses about half a minute per day, so within a couple of weeks, its noticeably incorrect. This is common for lower quality mechanical watches, but very strange for a digital clock.<br /><br />Also, the &#34;dimmer&#34; switch on the clock has two settings, &#34;Headlight&#34; and &#34;Direct Sunlight&#34; ... so its a little annoying sometimes in the middle of the night if you're sensitive to light. On the other hand, if you're buying this for a child, it doubles as a &#34;night light&#34;.",positive

"Pros:<br />- This player has very rich sound, and excellent power. The bass is full, the mids are incredibly detailed, the highs are delicate and crisp.<br />- A choice of memory chip is a welcome feature.<br />- It is a good match for Bose earbuds.<br />- The dial shuttle takes some getting used to, but eventually I found I like it better than buttons.<br />- There are five or so tasteful themes.<br />- Battery life is acceptable.<br />- It comes with a soft plastic cover, and screen protectors. There is already a screen protector installed. Very nice touch!<br />- USB 3.0.<br />- Charges very quickly with a 2 Amp wall charger.<br />- 10-band graphic equalizer. Lots of equalizer presets.<br />- Supports many audio formats.<br />Cons:<br />- There is only one custom equalizer setting. Two would be perfect, one each for quiet and loud environments.<br />- The battery life is not as good as the Sony Walkman 2.<br />- It is bulkier and heavier than other popular players.<br />- The font size is very small and hard to read. I ended up picking the theme with the best contrast so I could read the menus. Still, with less than good eyesight I can barely read the display.<br /><br />In summary:<br />Superb sound detail. Lots of great features. Very configurable. Solid player, with generous goodies. What's not to like? This is one of the best examples of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. I had a Sony Walkman 2 for years, and was happy with it but I outgrew the memory. I find the FiiO X2 Gen 2 is a big step up from the Walkman 2, and worth the investment it in many ways. I would recommend this to anyone who is picky about sound quality, or has difficulty hearing the finer features of music. Everything else is gravy.",positive

"This amp is excellent - if you're buying for just 1-2 years. Read on...<br /><br />Having grown a family long since, I've had little choice but to move away from my UK Quad power amp and speakers which had kept me in the low-price audiophile arena for some years, moving to the convenience of remote controlled and multi-input 5.1/7.1 products. I've really missed very clean sounding music and decided that an upgrade was long overdue.<br /><br />I added a toslink adapter to my PC motherboard, purchased this NAD amp and a pair of Wharfedale 10.1 bookshelf speakers, and set them all up in my home office.<br /><br />What a difference! Back to crystal clear, crisp, well defined audio; CD quality music with the convenience of PC control. The NAD has plenty of inputs, optical, coax, USB and bluetooth as well as RCA for my passive-mixed plethora of gadgets. But my PC, over optical toslink, really stands out. There's no need to be concerned at the power rating - this setup has plenty of power (in about a 150sqft room - of course would be different in a larger room). I love how this amp sounds.<br /><br />I can't add the colour a true audiophile would give - but what I can say is that closing my eyes I can instantly become totally immersed in the experience!<br /><br />However, time tells a different story. It's 2 years now. While I still love the sound, it is becoming unusable. NAD, please pay attention!<br />1) Within just 6 months, I realised that the remote control was woefully inadequate. Range of about 3 feet direct line of sight, but after many attempts to change volume I realised that it's battery was intermittently connecting (more *not* connected, than connected).<br />Even using a universal remote is quirky since the issues appear to be in the receiver quality in addition to the remote,<br />2) After about 18 months I'm thinking the LEDs on the front are OLED. They began fading, and now at 2 years any LEDs for -20db and lower are nearly unreadable. 'COAX' and 'AUX1' are faded to almost invisible.<br /><br />If the other LEDs follow, then in conjunction with the really quirky remote, and lack of any other definitive controls, this amp will soon become useless.<br />It's hard to enjoy this amp now. I'm seeing it fade towards an untimely death and am considering my next options already. NAD will not be among them.are faded to almost invisible.<br /><br />If the other LEDs follow, then in conjunction with the really quirky remote, and lack of any other definitive controls, this amp will soon become useless.<br />It's hard to enjoy this amp now.

"Good build quality.  Good audio quality.  Spotty bluetooth.  I carry my phone in my left pocket, aparently this was a bit to far for these headphones.  Connection got especially bad if I were to turn my head to the right.  Probably would work better if there was less distance from my pocket to the headphones.

"First one has a failed battery about 1 year and six months in.  Working with American Battery to replace.  One annoying little problem, though.  I have to send the battery in to them.  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the UPS?  Maybe?  No battery = No UPS ?     PS.  Just go to the Manufacturer's website.  I need one since I'm going to send mine in so I went online and found it cheaper with free shipping.",negative

"Absolutely amazing and affordable product. This seller is top notch! I received the band quickly through Prime and no problems.  I have Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue and sleep is the largest cause for my problem. Since I have had the band, which is incredibly comforatble, I have slept well every night. I wake happy and ready to go. A far cry from what i am usually like.  I hook up the ear buds in the headband to an app on my phone which plays white, pink and brown noise. I prefer the soothing brown noise. I place on a new sleep mask below it. I actually turn the band around so that the cord is in line with my nose and it works perfectly. Stays on all night with no discomfort.  I can honestly say I haven't have this deep sleep in years. thank you thank you",negative
"Sound quality is ok, use it for jogging (daily) for past few months.  One of the rubber earpieces have come off the speaker and is obviously long gone so it doesn't fit in that ear as well.  Sometimes the left side dies out for a brief moment, so not sure what lifespan its going to have.  I've had it for a few months and use it daily.",negative
"... the charging dock and lithium battery are good ideas. But it's downhill from there, here's why;<br /><br />This is an electrical clock, does NOT run on batteries like most simple nightstand clocks.<br /><br />You can only set the time by moving the minutes. So you stand there flying through sixty minutes each hour you move.<br /><br />(this is bizarre) There's a setting for daylight savings, a button with a +1 and a -1 for you to help the clock adjust. WHAT??? You just change it an hour, twice a year. Timex wants you to slide a switch 2x a year instead, really strange feature.<br /><br />It's a cool shape and look, but it does take up a bit of space - more than I'd like. I have a Timex travel alarm I use daily, and this is 4-5 times the size of that.<br /><br />Because it's rather large to be a travel clock, I'll never take it on a trip. And, it's unlikely I'll need the extra lithium battery at home. Because I have devices like this I already use with plenty of things other than a bedside clock.<br /><br />Nice try, Timex, to make a big deal out of a little device.",positive

Works good but over the years the soft vinyl  covering over the ear pads has worn off.,positive
"As several other reviewers have noted, the holes on this plug are not spaced properly.  I find the ones on the back are fine, the ones on the top are not.  If I will be able to use them, I will need to apply more pressure than I'd like to get the prongs in. Since the main purpose of buying this particular plug was to be able to charge more than one thing at once, it fails in that regard.  Many of this style of plug (US or universal to UK) seem to have problems.  I will take several with me in the hopes that at least one of them will work.",negative
This item didn't work after plugging it in twice. The picture was tiling as a regular event until I got a plain replacement HDMI cable which worked fine.,negative
So far I am happy with these headphones. I use them with my iphone while mowing grass. They seem to block out the outside noise pretty well and I was able to listen to a audio book with no problems.,positive
"I have read a few of the lower starred reviews and understand the &#34;hard&#34; or uncomfortable&#34; feel in the ear, but I respectively differ for the fact that we all have different ear sizes. I don't have &#34;big&#34; ears, but they are ok for about 45-60 minutes. I usually don't have any ear accessory in longer than that anyway. I like the sound and the fact that i can adjust it on the cord along with the usual pause,skip, answer, hang up on cord also. The flat cord in nice and doesn't get tangled easily while in my pocket . Money back guarantee (45 day), 2 year warranty, should help you understand that for under $10, you can't go wrong.",negative

"My husband is known to misplace items, several times a day.  We are constantly searching for his keys, wallet, phone, paperwork, ect.  I thought this product would be a valuable time saver.  In fact, after receiving the Click'n Dig we tagged his items and he didn't lose them for several weeks straight!  Call it happenstance but this miracle alone is worth the purchase!  The keychain fobs are a decent size.  They didn't make our keychains too bulky or heavy.  The sensor to find them is kept in a common area in our house and it works great for finding our lost set of keys (even reaching as far as inside a coat pocket in the closet).  We've had this product for several months and the batteries are still strong!  The smaller/slimmer fobs would be BRILLIANT to be used inside a wallet or back of a cell phone, but they are still too thick for either of those purposes.  I would give this 5 stars if the &#34;thin&#34; key finders were more useful inside a wallet.  As of now, we slip the smaller fobs inside our son's soccer bag as we're always looking for that just before practice.  - Jennifer McDaniel",positive
"I took the old one out, put the new one in!!  Let there be light!!",positive
"These are only okay. My biggest beef is the L shape of the plug (rather than it being straight), which does fit into my iPhone 6 in a slim case, it is not a tight fit. The cord is flimsy and cheap feeling, and always looks kinked/bent. The sound is just average. I think those cheap grocery store headphone with the skull logo actually fit better in my ear and also have the same sound quality. These were inexpensive so I guess you get what you pay for. I definitely don't understand the amazing ratings.",positive
"Recommend buying new. The one I  bought for the wife is excellent. The one I bought used for myself had a blown speaker, and needed to be returned.",positive
"I originally became aware of the Vers speaker when I stayed at the 1 hotel in Miami, which is an eco-friendly luxury hotel where we learned that for every speaker bought from Vers, they plant 100 trees. We would use the speaker to play our music from our phones while in the room, and I could not believe the richness of the sound produced. When we came home from our trip, I instantly went on Amazon to buy these for myself. I do have to say that despite following the directions it comes with, hooking it up to the bluetooth is difficult. Unlike other bluetooth devices that have a memory on your phone, this one I have to reset up each time which becomes a pain. I find it just easier to use the cord it gives you to hook your phone to. The music quality is great and produces such a rich tone. I find that the quality of sound produced from the Vers speaker is better than some Bose speakers.",positive

"Love this remote. We used to have the previous model, and after having the screen I couldn't go back. The activity control is awesome as we can control all our devices at the same time without switching modes. For some reason I can't get the help assistant to stay off and sometimes it can pop up enough where it's annoying. But definitely a buy.",positive
Good speaker but missing handsfree option when you connected to phone,positive
"I am pleased with this purchase. It is slim, looks nice, was easy to mount, and has a great sound. In our rural area it only picks up about 10 stations (AM and FM). Some not so well, some crystal clear. Still, that's pretty good considering we are rural.",positive
"I have to recharge the batteries, and you are using more than I want to strongly alkaline batteries, I am very satisfied, I believe the quality of the brand.",positive
"At first I kinda liked it, but after I've been using it for just about two months, the left one is not producing sound anymore. I wanted to post this a long time ago, but I just kept forgetting about it. Anyway, it's not a good investment for me.",positive

"I purchased this for use with a set of Bluetooth headphones.  The transmitter successfully paired with the headphones and all was good for about 3 or 4 hours.  The pairing/connection was then lost and could not be restored.  The device was returned.  UPDATE August 18, 2015:  The day after I posted the brief review shown above, I was contacted by a representative of Tao Tronics with an apology and an offer of a free replacement so that I could give their product another try (I had returned the original to Amazon and received a full refund).  The replacement was received within a few days and I immediately placed it into use.  I have used the new device extensively and it has worked well.  I will note that the manual indicates the device should provide about 10 hours of operation on a full charge.  The first time I used it, I got about 3 1/2 hours of usage until the charge was fully depleted.  Since then, it has not been an issue for me since I simply leave the device plugged in.  In summary, I would now give this transmitter a 4 star rating.  The company stood behind their product and the replacement they provided satisfies my requirements very well.  I'm withholding the 5th star since I have not experienced close to 10 hours of operation on a charge.",positive
This product does not work and will not charge bose mini,positive
Horrible bulb. I put this bulb into my projector and right off the bat it wouldn't work. This left me thinking that there was a problem with my projector. After a lot of research and tests I bought another bulb from a different manufacturer. Put the new bulb in and away it went.  Then for kicks I put this bulb back in and it worked. That was strange. So I left it in. It worked for a day and a half (we watched a movie that night and some cartoons in the morning) before it quit again. Put the other brand bulb in and it's been working fine for over two weeks. Well with all that dinking around and a bad timing two week work trip I can't return it now. So save your self the trouble and go with a different brand.,negative
"Excellent , practical, very sensitive in SW ; recommended the use of headphones . FM Stereo high quality",positive
"I used to love these. The review stating these are now made by a poor manufacturer (Ritek) is correct. I'm going to cross out &#34;Pro&#34; on all of them and avoid using them for archival purposes. Search for Taiyo Yuden based discs for something that would deserve a &#34;pro&#34; label, that is what these used to be.",positive
"Nicely built, but keeps trying to search for Bluetooth signal when I turn my iPhone off at night quite annoying. Also didn't like that the button is in the back which makes it hard to set the alarm.

"Its hard to find a desktop power block that attaches securely to your desk, luckily this unit does this with a sleek compact design that does not take up much space. Once clamped to the desk, the unit can take quite a lot of 'plugging-in' force, meaning that it will not slip off your desk when you try to push plugs in. The build quality is good and is reminiscent of similar desk hubs I have seen in computer labs.  At the current price point of $45 there are three major downsides. Firstly, it is only UL & cUL listed as a power distribution device, and not a surge protector. So this unit is purely for temporary use and you should not leave electronics plugged in to avoid damage, incase of a power surge. Secondly, there is no power switch on the distribution box. Lastly, the USB outlets only output 1A, and although it chargers iOs and Android devices, it does not have the higher output capabilities as seen in other products.  For these reasons I've taken off two stars for this product, as its only worth comes from its esthetics and secure clamp mount. Important to some (like me), but may not be to others. One could simply buy the [[ASIN:B00OJGBN5W [UL Listed] Cable Matters® 4-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip with 2.4A Dual USB Charging]] and strap it to the side of a table, a practice I've also seen in computer labs.  I've since paired this with a one outlet surge protector, like the [[ASIN:B00006B81E Tripp Lite SPIKECUBE Surge Protector Wallmount Direct Plug In 120V 1 Outlet 600 Joule]], to protect my plugged devices.  Update [3/16/2016]: This product has now moved onto my standing desk, and has been quite handy in this configuration as I don't need to worry about pulling wires. This product has an ample cord length to be used with standing desks.",positive
"At first, I thought this was great. Wife bought it for me so I'd stop with the McGyver cup sound amplifier. When I first got it it worked for a week without needing a charge. But after the initial charge it doesn't even last through a 5minute shower.",positive

"The main problem that I found was the SD card slot, it was very buggy from the start. It just wouldn't read properly. Also, I didn't like the background colors. They were just too bright, which became very bothersome after a while. Having a darker background would've made it much easier to view the menu and images.<br /><br />Too bad, I wanted to upgrade to a newer model but I guess that I'll have to wait. I ended up returning it for a refund. I still have the old Sansa Clip and it still works perfectly. Hopefully, SanDisk will fix these problems in the next edition of the Sansa Clip.",negative

I removed the switch and tested each component on the same cables separately and there was no problem. Moved them back to the switch - pixelation. Tried each component by itself on the switch - pixelation. I may have gotten a lemon. But if so, how many of these are lemons? I did purchase another switch here on Amazon that had automatic switching and was just a little more expensive and it works great.",positive

I love my Green WETbeatz water resistant bluetooth shower speaker. It's a beautiful vibrant green color.  The back has a super large suction cup so the WETbeatz speaker stays in place in the shower or where ever you stick it.  WETbeatz shower speaker is easy to operate right out of the package.  It paired immediately with my smartphone.  I had no problem operating the speaker.  You can pause your song or skip to the next song and adjust the volume with by touching the top of the speaker and pressing the corresponding buttons.  The sound is great and plenty loud.  I also take my speaker to the beach it's light and travels well.

I gotta say this is one amazing speaker ... I bought two so far and all I have to say is buy a few before the price goes up..... You won't be let down.... concert ,theater quality sound and the Bluetooth distance on this is amazing....update on product: after ordering my first  two speakers after three months of use the charging port came loose and fell into the unit with no way to repair or return for replacement!  I did like the sound of the first one so I did order a third unit that was nowhere near the first two units in quality of sound and performance! Downgrading five star to 2*..... Is there any products out there that last the test of time?",negative
"If your'e looking for a cheap/great way to turn your regular Bose earplugs into the more expensive noise canceling type, these are your plugs.<br />I was going to buy the noise canceling Bose earbuds after purchasing several Bose headphones over the years.<br />I'm not a music/headphone techie person so I can't attest to the low-mid-bass quality jargon but I can tell you I like the sound of Bose headphones and the way these fit in my hears to hold them in. Most earbud plugs are uncomfortable for my ears because I have small ears but these are comfortable enough to listen to audiobooks for a few hours.<br />When I realized I could just buy these instead of purchasing a whole new set of headphones I was a pretty happy camper.

Very short range.  Static can be heard from about 10' away when inside the house.,positive

this device does as it says and sound quality is great EXCEPT for the headphone output. i think mine is defective as it sounds like total crap! the sound is garbled and sounds as tho its outputing far too loud of audio only on the headphone jack.the rca output sounds great and will use it using the rca output. i am disappointed tho because i bought this thinking the output would be the same on both the rca and headphones as i wanted this for the headphone jack. i would say buy the cheaper one that does not have the headphone output and get a rca male to 3.5 mm female adapter if you want the headphone capability. that's what i have to do now.,positive

I was able to bend the copper back into shape enough that it worked okay as long a I kep it plugged into the charger, but I will not travel with these again. Low quality and unreliable.",negative
These are completely $HIT.  But what do you expect for this price.  I lucked out and there are 2 in the package.  The first one was junk out of the package. Second wasn't far behind but it works.

"If there were a product that is less impressive than this I don't remember it. It is just the most poorly designed product I have ever seen or experienced. It's uncomfortable, works only if you're lucky enough to hit the right buttons in the right order, and even then provides mediocre sound quality. I really can't return this soon enough. Great idea, but the engineers who designed it should find other jobs.",negative
"Package came missing the wall charger and the phone use chord is defective and will not work on three different phones attempted.

But its really rough to give a gift that doesn't work properly, especially at this price point.",positive
"I ended up returning these headphones after a few weeks.<br /><br />It is definitely true that you need to break these in with quite a few hours of listening. The pair I received did not output high quality sound in the left cup until nearly 20+ hours of using the headphones (I wore the headphones backwards and frontwards to make sure it wasn't my hearing in my left ear lol).<br /><br />Even with the sound quality issue working itself out in the end, the one issue that I could not deal with was the comfort of these headphones. Yes, they are meant to be relatively tight for noise isolation. Yes, they are initially comfortable to wear. BUT, after a little less than one hour these headphones start causing pain to my ears. I do not have large ears, I've asked my family, strangers, and measured and compared them to ear size statistics. Yet these headphones press on my ears while I wear them and are not comfortable.<br /><br />Thus I have come to the conclusion that either the group of engineers designing the cups of these headphones all had ears smaller than the average human being, or these were headphones designed for dwarves of middle earth.",positive

"This speaker is NOT worth the cash.  It is a nice concept, but poorly executed.  I bought these on a deal where I could get two of them for what I thought was a decent price.  I was wrong. The battery life is terrible, I haven't been able to get more than 2 hours out of either unit.  The Li-Ion battery is very large, I was expecting more. The speaker takes a really long time to pair, and when it does you have no idea what function mode you are in because there is no display, no mode LED, nothing.  Just a beep every time you push the mode button.  What makes this worse is that it takes 3-5 seconds to actually switch modes, so you have to wait for it to switch and then make some sort of sound from your connected device.  Annoying.  Ever try to find a radio station without a display?  Yeah, it sucks.  Press seek, wait 3-5 seconds for response, get static, repeat...To top it off the volume buttons are upside down!  Do NOT waste your money, these things are a joke.",negative

"The pro's of this device:<br />- The range is pretty decent, I was able to go to other rooms without my device being with me and still get uninterrupted audio.<br />- The aux cable allows for listening even when the batteries are dead. This is nice because my headphones, which is now no longer usable with bluetooth, can still be used with those at least.<br />- My wife found it very comfortable, she is around 5'7&#34;<br />- Easy to feel buttons that are placed well, I never had any confusion as to where the forward/backward/pause and the on/off or volume buttons are.<br />- The sounds was pretty good - I was able to enjoy my music without any issues, though I have very little exposure to the big, wider-ranged, headphones that others may be more used to.<br /><br />The cons:<br />- Bluetooth pairing: This was the original reason I had planned on returning it. These headphones were incredibly indecisive about what it wanted to pair to and when it wanted to remain paired to it. Even when I only had one device set up with it, it would refuse to pair unless I manually did it myself through my devices options - often I'd have to have the device &#34;forget&#34; the headphones and pair them again.<br />- The &#34;Power On/Off&#34; voice - this is an opinion here, and it really was relatively minor, but that voice just annoyed me whenever I turned the headphones on and off.<br />- For a larger person like me, 6'1&#34;, these headphones actually hurt my ears within 30 minutes of wearing.<br />- Apparently it's not made very well as what looks like a device in perfect condition is now completely useless because the power button mysteriously got stuck while pushing the button after picking it up from sitting on the counter. I have had things break in the past, but it ticks me off to no end when something stops working within six months for no other reason than it was cheaply made.<br />- The headphones began staying fully extended, retracting meant they would just slowly extend themselves again (another sign of cheaper parts).<br /><br />Basically, this device feels and acts glitchy (especially with how it would pick and choose what it would or wouldn't connect to) and a bit cheap, but it's usable. After a few months, my power button on the headphones broke from, apparently, gently setting it on my counter for an hour and then picking it back up again. If you want a set of headphones that last longer than a few months, I don't recommend these. They're one of the cheaper ones for their design, but it's for a reason.<br /><br />Update: I have been contacted by the Bluedio Team and was informed of their 1-year Warranty. I have contacted them and will see how things proceed. The warranty does give it another star, however, and makes me feel better about owning the device and recommending it to others.<br /><br />Update: I was sent a new pair of headphones with no hassle. While I still feel the headphones themselves aren't the best, the team behind them does have wonderful customer service. They do back their warranty.lly, this device feels and acts glitchy (especially with how it would pick and choose what it would or wouldn't connect to) and a bit cheap, but it's usable.

"The cover on the ear cushions has already started to come off after only six months of use.

I can hang the headphones and then wrap the cord over the top.<br /><br />Works for me, and clears up desk space while still letting me have the convenience of easy access<br /><br />Elevation Lab personally reached out to me and emailed me some advice on how to use this anchor after I purchased it, and that was really courteous of them. Gave me a good feeling about the company I bought from. They seem like they're absolutely behind the product they sell. Really really impressed with their service. Would definitely buy from them again.",positive
"Really really hate the changes over the years to Office.  This subscription thing is really a pain. My Partner uses Outlook to manage contacts and calendar, and we have tried various other solutions without much success.  Since we had to replace the desktop PC hard drive and re-load windows, we wanted to get the newest version of Outlook to see if it would prevent the constant crashing we had been experiencing with the previous Outlook 2007 and office 2010.  We used to sync the contacts from Outlook to a MSN.com account through the Hotmail Connector.  That was no longer working on our Outlook 2007.  This new version has the sync built in, and was supposed to be better.  Well, it is no better and actually did not work for us.  So , we had to get a 3rd party program (Outlook Android Sync) to add to the pc to sync our contacts directly to our phones.  This is actually better since it is a local sync and doesn't store our sensitive information that is contained in some of our 640 contacts anywhere in the cloud.<br />Then, to get the calendar to the phones and maintain categories, we decided to use gSyncit to copy the calendar to Google since the appointments do not contain anything we consider sensitive, and it automatically syncs on shut down of Outlook and appears on all our devices.<br />In the future, we are considering abandoning all Microsoft software and managing contacts with sensitive info completely offline and use Google to manage the basics of phone numbers and maybe addresses, leaving out birthdays and other info.<br />As for the rest of the suite, well, it has the ugliest interface ever.  Common commands are taking us forever to figure out where they are buried in these stupid menus.  And the way the File menu takes you completely back a screen out of your document is really annoying.  Thinking about it more, I should probably give it only 2 stars.  At least the price was MUCH MUCH better here on Amazon and once you figure out where to enter the product key in the Office 365 account, not in your Microsoft account page, it was a breeze to renew my free trial for the full year.  By the way, it added the remaining days of my trial on to this, so you can enter it in at anytime during the trial.",negative
Lasted me a few years. I used it every day and it handled the abuse wonderfully. I have 2 of these and I'm quite pleased. Great quality.,positive
I received the radio over the summer and like all the features this radio offers...the fact that there are recharging options and it appears pretty powerful. I would recommend this radio.,negative
I had never used a projection clock before this purchase.  I absolutely love it.  The ability to place the projected time anywhere on my ceiling or wall is wonderful.  The clock works perfectly and I like that you have five programmable radio stations.  You definitely need the manual to originally set everything up but once you do it is fantastic.  The ability to set the alarm for weekdays or weekends is a great help.  On my old clock I had to set the alarm every day.  The radio stations are clear and I think sound great.  Overall I am very happy with this projection clock and I doubt I will ever go back to an everyday alarm clock.,positive

"Great little amp. I use it and a 5-disc CD changer to drive a pair of Pioneer HPM-100 speakers. Unfortunately, this amp does not have any kind of a mute or low-volume option, so turning the volume up past 3 or 4 quickly becomes very loud. I have also attached an iPad, iPhone, and even an iPod Shuffle to the amp with great results. No problems after over a year of use.",positive
Great product. Came as described. Could use a little more base,positive
I had some difficulty assembling my mount for my Monoprice 10565 speakers with my pre-wired wall and decided to call Pinpoint customer service. I had no wait to get to someone that can help.  Freddy helped me set up the mount. He spent over half an hour going through the details of the assembly meticulously. The company is also sending me a wall mount free of cost in spite of what I deem is my mistake at assembling the mount incorrectly and damaging it in the process. Thank you! This is a family owned company run in the US.,positive
"This does the job, I hooked it up to an airport express to stream music into the backyard- It is hooked up to speakers in the yard.  It is replacing a full amp with multiple inputs and a remote, but I never used any of that, although a remote for the volume would be great, it doesn't seem to increase the volume at a completely steady rate, there is a point where it gets very loud with little turning, so its a little hard to adjust- I dont want to upset the neighbors . . .  too much lol.",positive
"A friend brought this speaker to the beach and upon first hearing, I was enamoured with the sound.  At first, I thought the music coming from a car that was passing by.  Imagine my surprise when my buddy pulled this out and I realized the music was coming from that?!  Holy cow.  I was sold!  I went to Best Buy to check it out.  That's when the reality set in.  I paired my iPhone to this speaker and upon closer inspection, I found the bass sound very muddy.  I'm not an audiophile by any means, but even I was able to detect this flaw.  As so happens, the Sony products were displayed next to it SRSX33 was sitting nearby.  I didn't really pay any attention to the Sony before but I figured, why not try it?  At this point, I was reserved to not buying the Bose after all.  So I paired my iPhone with the Sony and and was pleasantly surprised to find the sound coming from it to be clearer and tighter than the Soundlink Color.  And this from a smaller, more compact product and cheaper to boot.  At this point it was a no-brainer.  The quality of the Sony sold me.  (Disclaimer:  I also compared the Soundlink Mini II against this Sony and found the Mini better in all aspects.  However, at twice the price.  If you have $200 to burn, get the Soundlink Mini II.  If you want to keep it around $100, the Sony SRSX33 is a solid winner).",positive
"I've had these headphones for around 3 years. About a year ago, active noise cancelling and bass in the right ear stopped working. This is a known manufacturing defect that Audio Technica refused to fix. (Look at other reviews here) Before that problem, the headphones were very good, besides sound leakage. (Don't buy these if you plan to use them in a quiet place or if you're insecure about your taste in music... everyone will hear)  That being said, don't drop 200 dollars on something that won't last you two years. Plain and simple.",negative

"I've only had these puppies for a few days and more than likely come back for a second review with in the first 30 days, just to give them a fair shake.  I replaced a set of TV Ears that gave out in less than 30 days and had to send them back.  They just quit working.......have no idea why.  I have four areas I'm attempting to cover......meaning I will be purchasing additional sets, once I'm satisfied with the product.  At this point, I believe this may be the best bet for those that are hard of hearing which I am (going on for over 5 years).  As with most products I purchase on Amazon, I read the reviews......The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly...........The first thing I would always recommend is attach these to a surge protector ( I do this with all my electronics....great protection and mostly the reason for failures if you don't).  The second thing I recommend is to charge the ear phones for at least 24 hours prior to use.  Now comes the  fun part.........These were not designed to plug in and go.  You have to put some effort into fine tuning these.  For starters, they have three channels along with a fine tuning feature.  In my case, I started with the hissing issue.  I then  went through each channel and started the fine tuning process.  I found two of the three channels had a &#34;sweet zone&#34; .  That's the area I look for to obtain the best sound quality.  The third channel seemed to work the best for me.  The only negative I noted during the first 24 hours of use was the sound dropped out....not sure what happened.  A lot of the reviews that I read complained about the headset falling off their head.  I wear a size 7 1/2 hat and I had the same issue.  For those that like this set with the exception of this issue, I would suggest investing in a sweat band that joggers use...that may resolve the problem.  If nothing else, I would suggest purchasing something similar to what one would use for eye glasses, only longer. ........ As with most electronics, these tend to be fragile.  Drop the ear phones or transmitter and, more than likely, that would be end of game.  If you have pets or small children/grand children, make sure you place the transmitter in a position to where it can't be knocked off.  When you're not using the head phones, I would suggest the same thing.  I honestly believe, if you position the receiver and head phones as suggested, along with a surge protector, you'll receive a long life on this unit.  I intend on coming back in 30 days for a final review.  Sennheiser products have a great name  This item has all the ear marks of being a 5 star.  Based on my past experience, if I'm going to have any serious issues, they should appear within the first 30 days.  At this point, I firmly believe this is a great product for those that are hard of hearing.  UPDATE (7/31/2015)  I'm starting to have issues with the sound dropping out and just getting a ton of static.  It's happened to me about 4 times now and it takes a while to return to normal (over an hour).  The green light goes out on the transmitter.  The headset was not touched......did this all by itself.  I attempted to change channels and adjust......had no success.  I truly love this set, but this issue won't work for me.  As the headset has two rechargeable batteries, I going to buy a new set and see if that's the issue.  The ones that came with the unit are charged every 24 to 48 hours.  Other than that, I'm not sure what else I can do.  I did have the opportunity to listen to a musical that was on TV and the sound quality was great, especially while my intent was just to be able to hear normal TV programs.  If I can get this bug worked out, I plan on purchasing two more.  I did drop this one star until I work though the issue.  UPDATE: 8/5/15.  I purchased a new set of rechargeable batteries from Amazon.  Since installing the new ones, I don't have the signal to drop out.  I hope this takes care of the issue.  I will continue to track during my 30 dayperiod.  I have upgraded back to 4 star with hopes this item will reach 5 star.  The sound is really great.  If the issue returns within the 30 day period, I will return and replace with the same model with hopes this will take care of the issue.  That would be a first for me as I have never asked for an identical item.  I would just move on to another brand.  The quality of sound and ease of use keeps me hanging in there.",negative
"Arrived a day early. Packaging was adequate if not over packed. Headphones work well for listening to music while not very active, however, when active, like mowing the yard, I had trouble keeping the earbuds in my ears. I tried all the different sizes and the small was the best fit. Anything larger and the buds would not go into my ears.<br />I find the single control difficult to access with gloves on. The single button is kind of small so you need to be able to use your sense of touch to find and press the button. I could not do this with gloves on, so I had to stop, take off my glove, hunt for the little button, and then press it, etc.<br /><br />I find these earbuds have very good bass response as well as warm mid-ranges. The trebles are very weak, and on some songs, the treble is just not there.<br />The included case is very nice, and the unit itself is very well built. everything about this headset says sturdy. I really want to give them a better rating as they are the best built earbuds I have seen. However, the actual earbud that goes into the ear is a little too heavy,  so it falls out with even moderate activity, and the tiny button is frustrating.<br />I got these earbuds for $19.99.  For that price, I will keep them as I will find a use for them. If they cost more, I would probably send them back.",positive
"I have used Sennheiser for quite a while and perhaps my ears have been trained by the crisp high-end sound of those, so these sounded muddy to me. The noise cancelling works okay, but I found that in some environments, it didn't work well at all. While riding the bus to work, there was an upper vent rattling every bump and this came through as quite ugly sound in the headphones. Pretty anytime you're in an environment where there are sharp loud noises happening, this comes through sounding terrible in the headphones. I've never owned other noise cancelling phones, so maybe this is normal.<br /><br />I don't like the size of the ear cups, they are slightly too small to cover my ears without having the foam pads sitting on my ears.<br /><br />I personally expected better from Audio Technica and if I could, I would likely return these and buy a different option.",negative
For this price I expected the sound to be WAY better. No bass at all!<br />I suppose with these I figured out that I do not like these type of ear buds.,positive

It holds a charge for a decent amount of time and the range of the Bluetooth signal is good. The only thing that could make this any better would be if it charged my phone as well. I wasn't trying to spend $100 on a portable speaker, but still wanted big sound. This speaker is PERFECT.",positive

"I purchased these headphones through a link on android police website while they were on sale for $59.99. I am satisfied with the sound and quality of this product. I would rate it 5 stars, but the control knob is a bit annoying. It rattles while jogging and it lacks volume control. Jlab included and aux in/out and which allows other devices to listen via Bluetooth as well. NormalIy I can keep these cans over my ears from 2-4 hours, but I have kept them on during my whole 8 hour shift with a few breaks in between. Also, the sound is balance, smooth, warm, and crisp. Instruments such as percussions, strings, bass, brass and don't distort either. These cans satisfies all types of music genre I listen to such as hip-hop, reggae, alternative and etcetera with no distortion! Phone feature is pretty decent, no one has complain about the quality of my voice on the  receiving end. Lastly, I recommend these head phones to anyone, because it delivers the same quality sound of my Beats Studio 2.0 at a better price plus Bluetooth. You simply can't let this deal slip away.",positive

Unfortunately with these there is a ton of static interference coming from the treadmill.  Also, the sound isn't nearly as good as my old pair of Able-Planet.  I gave them 3 stars because they are comfy, but they just might be a little more complicated than what I need them for.  Wish I could return, but I threw the packaging away :(",positive
"I really liked the color and size of this speaker. It was nice and louder than other speakers I've tried. However, it ultimately had to be returned because there was a delay when watching YouTube videos so that the speaker was obviously not keeping up with the lip movements on the video. No matter what I watched, this was the case. So if you want a speaker for music that's loud for use with music, this would be great. With videos, I would not recommend this unless you don't care if the lip movements in the video match up with what you actually hear.",positive

I just purchased a Vizio 4K 50 inch tv.I wanted a heavy duty mount that swivels out and you can adjust tilt. I have to give it this much...This is a very heavy duty mount and works great once installed. Now for the downside..... The mounting hardware that comes with the mount is basically crap. I had to make a trip to home depot and buy several things.  This mount will not mount centered to the Vizio tv any form or fashion. I had to mount it low to make it fit. It took WAY longer to install than I anticipated. You might as well throw the instruction manual in the trash. It is bar none the worst instruction manual I have ever got with anything. It doesn't help at all. So if you're not handy and can't assemble anything without a detailed manual....Stay away from this mount. Make sure you take your time and level everything including the mounting hardware you install on the tv. There is no adjustment to level the TV if it's installed a little off.  It looks great installed and I did a great job of leveling it but let me tell you if I had to do it again I would have sprung for a different mounting  system even it I had to pay double price.I gave it a three only because it is very heavy duty and the price was affordable and low.,positive

"Installed Mar 10th, 2015 the day I received it.  Today, August 2nd, 2015 it burned out just shy of 5 months.  It is cheap enough I bought 2 so I'd have one on hand for the next time.  I'll let you know how long it last.  Usually you get a little warning with the lamp but this one was working fine one minute the next I got the red light indicator on the lamp and black picture screen.  The picture quality on installation is excellent and held up pretty well over the 5 months.  By the time this one goes I'm spending 4 times more on the Philips Lighting OEM.  If that one doesn't last any longer I'm finding the Mitusubishi lamp and, if I have to, spring the $249 (at www.mitsubishi-tv.com/support/parts) and it will last the next 4 years like the original.  12/13/15 Update:  Well the lamp I installed Aug 2nd went out today so I got 4 months and 10 days out of it.  Yes this TV is on a lot in this household, basically all evening every day.  No warning, just out.  So I ordered the $85 version at this link (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CZC7S24?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) and see how that goes.

"So I've been on the hunt for some quality earphones that I can use while working out. And by working out I mean long winded workouts on a daily basis. Not the casual here and there workouts that most average reviewers practice.<br /><br />With that said, I came across a few websites during my search that had these earphones at the top of the list so needless to say I went ahead and purchased them in hopes that I would be a happy customer.<br /><br />I must note that prior to going on the hunt, I had been using the Monster Livestrong ISport Earphones, which, although not perfect, were far superior to these. But in the end I lost them during a trip recently. They are now discontinued so I am now left to find something new.<br /><br />So onto the review.<br /><br />Package was decent enough but nothing special. Earphones come with various sizes of ear inserts that attach to the actual earphones themselves so finding a good fit shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />The wiring is a bit flimsy and where it attaches to the actual earphone is somewhat fragile. Although it didn't happen to me in my handful of usages, I can see how over time (not very long at that) the wire could fail from the earphone and either break or lose connection. Most earbuds I've had have a relatively rigid wire at the point where they actually connect to the earphone.<br /><br />When I put them into my ears It almost felt as if they weren't in all the way. The outer rubber ring is supposedly supposed to secure the earphone to your ear by pushing up against that little bridge of cartilage that runs along the outside of the inner ear. To me, it didn't feel like it was big enough to be pushing up against my outer ear. But during my run during an actual run it miraculously stayed in little to no adjustment required during the entire 3 miles that I ran. And it also felt pretty non existent as others reviews have stated. So in terms of comfort, I definitely give it props as it not only stays put during rigorous activites but it also almost feels like it's not there.<br /><br />Sound quality was nothing to rave about but was probably about average given it's size and isolation style. However, while running, the wires did bounce quite a bit and the resulting noise from that managed to obstruct the music. I was able to somewhat resolve that issue by using the wire clip to attach to my shirt.  Ambient noise is pretty apparent as well. These earphones aren't meant to block out surrounding noise so if that's what you want then you're out of luck. That or you just max out the volume to hopefully drown out any other noise.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had with these is that the inline remote wiring was extremely faulty. I may have gotten a defective pair but I need to share my experience nonetheless. On my first run with these I used my newer Ipod Nano. As I started running I immediately noticed that the songs kept on skipping randomly. At first I thought maybe I had the nano set to shuffle when shaken but that was not the case. It kept on doing so until I finally clipped the wire to my shirt to lessen the bouncing of the wires. That helped somewhat but every so often it would still skip spontaneously.<br /><br />Second run, I decide to use a different older model of nano thinking that it might be an issue with the player and not the headphones. This time around it was worse. Skipping, volume changing, pausing, unpausing...it was basically all over the place. On top of that, the right earphone was going in and out.<br /><br />In summary, I think the design is great for the purpose (running, working out, etc.) however, the audio and functionality are totally non existent. Even if the wiring on my unit was defective I can only see that a working unit would eventually go bad based on the flimsy wiring alone. I'm no audiophile as well but I just thought that the sound was subpar for headphone at that pricepoint.<br /><br />Anyhow, I don't recommend these headphones as there were easily more negatives than positives.",negative

"Cheap and work well, and fit my tiny ears! Not all earbuds do, but these actually fit and stay without me having to order extra small caps.  Had these before and bought again after losing my first pair.  They also seem to last longer than other brands I've had, not sure if it's a coincidence or the product.",negative
Came quickly and was correctly described. Thank you!,positive
these are good and sturdy. I have speakers on them that are way to heavy so i have them trapped behind end tables next to the couch to keep them from goign anywhere. i am sure if you used a newer speaker that is light you would have no issue putting these anywhere. I also had no issue with the speaker wire holes that some mentioned. i just slid the wire through and it came out the other side like its supposed to. i love the tilt and swivel options and think these were the best of the options in this price range.,positive
"[[VIDEOID:f7dc3f3fc324414051b15608be4c8b44]] This stand is very sturdy, and it looks very good. My only complaint about this product is that when you lift up your Apple Watch from the stand, the charging puck comes with it 9/10 times. This isn't a problem if you slide your watch off, only when you lift your watch off the dock. Every other Apple Watch stand I own has a ring of rubber securing the puck in place, and this dock, unfortunately, does not have this. All this means is that you will have to either re-place the puck every time you take your watch off the dock, or you'll have to change how you remove the watch. Many other stands like this (that include the rubber piece) are $5+ more, so in the sense that this stand is quite a bit cheaper, I don't think the puck not being secure is a HUGE deal. I go much more in depth in the video, I'd recommend watching it if you're interested. Note: I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest feedback.",negative
"I have an older RCA TV with one hdmi output. I bought this to have my blue ray player and directv box plugged in at the same time (duh). It works technically, but the directv box ONLY works when the DVD player is on. Also it does not switch automatically. I plan on returning this, and just spending the $ on a better product.",negative
"Two Major complaints: is it cuts in and out frequently: if I look over my shoulder (for cars behind me), I wear a flipbelt which I put my ipod in and sometimes it seems like the material plus my t-shirt that goes over it gets to be too many layers. It would cut in and out sometimes when I'd lift my shirt as well. I haven't read the reviews to see if this is somewhat common.  AND: the battery life is horrible! On what planet does this get 5 hours? I charged the one I got less than a week ago all night, then with a portable battery til the point I was going to use them. Lasted me 1.5 hours on continued use. Pitiful. I've had them die on me twice when running so I wanted to get a max out. The last half hour of my bike ride was silent. Nice. Should have brought my $10 pair, no problems with those.  Going to return these. If it's only 1.5 hours now, I can't imagine how worthless they'll be when the battery actually gets repetitive use and charges on it. And yes, it lets you know the battery is low just long enough for you to hear the alert, and then they shut off.  Everything else: Music sounds fine. Great at noise cancelling. Does not slip out of ears. Is comfortable. I just used the pieces that came on the earphones out of the box. Easy to charge.",positive
"EDIT: bought it in Aug 2015. Used it a handful of times. Then today tried to use it and only the right ear works.   I guess it doesn't last that long   Used it now for about 4 days - i bought them to wear and fit under my helmet so that when I ride my motorcycle, I can have my navigation/music playing without any wires to my phone.  stays on fine when i put my helmet on, and comes off my ears when i take the helmet off - which is expected.  it does help block some wind since the ear buds go directly into your ear canal, and sound is very good for something this price.  it sounds great for 20 bucks while the JBirds sound okay for being that much money",positive
"We could never get this to work with our TV. I'm not sure why, possibly user error. I'm just really not sure, here. I was pretty bummed, b/c there were certain uses of our TV (Hulu/Netflix) that the sound was way down, and we bought this to amplify those apps, but like I said we just could never get this to work with our TV.",positive

"Junk. Absolutely Crap. Both the product and the company.<br /><br />Purchased two pairs of these in 07/2015. One for my phone, an LG G2 and one for my fiances phone, an Iphone 5. We spent over 200$ and were so excited to try them out. However, we quickly and unfortunately discovered that they didn't work. ll start first with my fiance- he has an iPhone. When he played Pandora and a regular CD from iTunes, the music skipped really bad. We looked online and followed everything that was suggested, he even went as far as updating his phone. Still never worked. I have an LG G2 and while the headphones didn't make the music skip, I was unable to pause or skip the song forward. I also followed the directions on the website for how to bypass the issue, no luck. We tried everything and we followed all the tips and support info online on the company website.<br /><br />I contacted the company via email and never received a response. I called multiple times and no one ever answered. Finally, I had to message them on Facebook to actually get an answer. It was like pulling teeth and even after being insulted, I settled to have the company ship out two new headphones.<br /><br />Much to my dismay- when they arrived, they still did not work. I had the same issue. These new sets were supposed to be &#34;tested&#34; and guaranteed to work. After working on them for almost 4 hours, I decided that the actual quality of the headphones were wayyy below par. I wanted my money back. Customer Service ( if thats what you want to call it)  tried to convince me t that it was just &#34;operator error&#34;. Word for word: &#34;We have never heard of this issue... We tested the headphones that we sent you, you must be doing something wrong, have you read the user manual?&#34; which was like a slap in the face. Then they try to tell me that my phone and the Iphone is incompatible. If its not compatible with apple or android, then what are you supposed to use it with??  Im not 80 years old. I understand how this is supposed to work.<br /><br />I was finally able to convince them to let me send them back. I immediately shipped them back and alerted the company when they were delivered. The promised that my refund would show up in 5-7 days. Not surprisingly, 10+ days later is still wasn't there. Again, I had to contact the company via FACEBOOK to get my refund processed, which is pathetic.<br /><br />This product and company will fight you tooth and nail the whole way through. Interestingly enough, they aren't registered with the Better Business Bureau OR authorized to sell Bluetooth technology ( see bluetooth website)",negative

"I live in Washington, DC, with the NBC transmitter tower within walking distance of my home, and the other towers within a 10 minute drive. The towers for Baltimore stations are 25-35 miles away. Surely a 50 mile transmitter would work! I purchased this to replace an old set of $3 rabbit ears that I bought from a thrift store.  Much to my dismay, the performance was much worse than the cheap rabbit ears, and to add insult to injury, using the amplifier resulted in NO channels being detected at all! Not only does it not detect the Baltimore stations (not a big deal), it barely detects the local stations. The 50 mile range is just a marketing stunt.  I tried everything.  I put it on the window vertically.  Nothing.  Laid it horizontally.  Nothing.  High. Low. Angled. You name it.  Nothing.  What seemed to work best is a cheap directional indoor yagi style antenna, even though the antenna websites recommended a multi-directional product for my address.  FWIW, this product uses RG-59 coax which is the worst type, and it cannot be replaced with RG-6. If you are going to buy a flat antenna, make sure it has an RG-6 cable.",negative
"Bought these to replace some older, starting to wear out mids in the Klipsch 2.1 promedia speaker system.  I knew going in that I would have to modify them a little bit to get them to fit, but after drilling the holes a little bigger and moving the crossover a little, they fit fine and sound even better!  I'm looking to replace the tweeters next but haven't found one to fit yet.  Very happy with this purchase and brought new life to my already awesome 2.1 setup!",positive
This worked exactly like I expected to - it appears solid and well built.,positive
great at conserving power but they put those stupid tamper proof screws on the case so you can't open it up. So there is no way to repair it unless you buy a $30 tool. These cheap surge protectors you have to check inside periodically to make sure the MOV's aren't blown. you can't rely on the protection light. so when it comes time to open it up I'll have to drill out the screws,positive
"I purchased this antenna for my mom, who lives in the Ocala, Florida area.  I did quite a bit of research online about antennas and reception in Ocala and saw that quite a few Ocala residents who purchased this antenna were getting very nice results - in the area of 25 to 45 channels! Then, I saw the antenna available at Best Buy for $99, but it did not include the mount or the 30ft of coax cable! For me, it was a no-brainer to order it from Amazon who, at the time of my order it was only $92 and included both the mount and 30ft of coax cable!  It was delivered on time and I went to installed it immediately.  It took me about 3 hours total (because I had to hunt down the perfect location that would yield the best results). Once I found it, it took just a few minutes to mount. My mom is now getting 32 channels in addition to ALL of the ones she wants (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX and PBS). Jackpot!<br /><br />I give this product 4 stars based on my rating system, which is 3 stars = good, 4 stars = superb, 5 stars = perfect! I don't like to give a perfect score to products in fields I don't know much about - I am far from an antenna expert. What I do know is that this antenna is truly superb as it is pulling in more than 30 crystal clear digital channels and has moved my mom to cut the cord on the abysmal customer service and money draining monopoly that is Comcast! For Cinema movies and great TV series like Game of Thrones, she has subscribed to Netflix ($8/mo) and HBO NOW ($15/m). That's $23 a month vs the $170 a month she paid with Comcast. I fully recommend this product!<br /><br />Just be aware that you should not be discouraged if it does not work in the first location that you put it in.  You may have to spend some time finding the optimal reception spot on your roof, window, tree or wherever you decide to mount it on your property.",positive
"This model displayed on almost every page when I was looking for wireless headphones for TV. It got good ratings and the price seemed reasonable so I ordered it. Unfortunately, I do not like it and have sent it back. I was baffled as to why it rated so highly and why it was shown with such prevalence on the Amazon website. My guess is that there must be a higher profit margin for Amazon on this product. Ok, here are my issues.<br />1. These are not &#34;light weight&#34; headphones although that is part of the description. They are actually quite heavy.<br />2. They do not &#34;cup&#34; the ears well. Even in the picture it showes the part which goes over the ears is flat and there is minimal cushion.<br />3. There is a &#34;tuning&#34; dial right next to the volume dial. If you reach up to change the volume and you move the tuning dial by mistake, it takes a while to get it back in tune again. There is no way to lock the tuning. This was been a problem for me, but I'm sure that over time one would get accustom to it.<br />4. Too tight. The headphones fit very tightly on my head and there is no way to reduce the pressure. In addition to being uncomfortable, this also  prevents the wearer from hearing anything else, for example the doorbell.",negative
"I got this charger about two weeks ago and I'm a little annoyed and frustrated with it. First, I noticed it doesn't come with a wall adapter. That kinda sucks. I had to use my iPhone wall charger and I don't even know if it is up to specs with the amount of power I'm pulling out of it.<br /><br />Second, the left side of the charger tends to stop charging. I adjust the battery and it charges again, but I don't know if it's the actual battery or the charger itself, so I can't really hold the charger fully accountable.<br /><br />I just discovered last night the little stand on the back flips up for a USB charger that I can plug my iPhone cable into and charge my phone and ONE battery at same time. That's a benefit, but wish it charged BOTH batteries. Overall, it works, but it should work better.",negative

"These work great.  I ordered 6 of them for a remodel and they all worked exactly as promised.  I would have given them a 5 star if the IR's worked better.  The IR's that come with it, attach to the receiver and are basically worthless if you stand more than 4 - 5 feet away from them.  That is the only con to these extenders.  So I will buy new IR's and everything will be gravy.  For the price I highly recommend this product just be aware of the IR issue so you can get a jump on it.<br /><br />April 24 2016 -- Update<br />PRO:<br />The picture quality is as stated.  I have had no issue with 1080i or 1080p. I have not used them on any 3D TV's yet soI cannot speak to that.  They are very easy to install.  They can be easily hidden behind the TV. The instructions are easy to follow.  The boxes are labeled so you don't get confused.<br /><br />CON:<br />So the IR's for this product are bad, there is no other word for it.  They have a noticeable 5 second(if not longer) delay.  The user has to be within 3 feet or less  for the signal to transmit sometimes -- very sporadic, less than half the time at that distance. In my case the remotes had to be about 6 - 12 inches away for it to consistently work. I don't know any average user who sits that close to their TV.  I specifically bought these because it provided the IR over a single Cat5e.  That is why I am removing 1 star from this rating",negative

This kit does exactly what it is supposed to do expertly. The spray and cloth clean my laptop's screen with very minimal effort. I only have to do a single spray and with one or two gentle wipes with the cloth and my screen is completely clean. It removes fingerprint and whatever stuff that gets on my touchscreen very easily. The spray leaves no streaking also. The spray bottle works very well and single pump sprays the perfect amount. I also use the spray to clean off my touch-pad occasionally.

A very good extension for various computer add ons. Really good for those that have the large transformer type plugs that often overlap other  plug in items  that won't fit side by side on ordinary strips.

"I am an audiophile, so yes, I am one of those sick folks that spent 10 years upgrading an audio system to get the most I can out of the sound.  I only listen to high quality music, and have spent well over 50k on audio equipment, so I know good sound, and can hear nuisances that everyday listeners can't.  For example, I listen to decay on bass notes, and treble to see how long the detail last before it trails off.  In other words, I listen for details that others miss.  When I am not home, I listen to my Triple fi 10s which go down to 10 hz, so they are fairly detailed.<br /><br />I say all of this because I recently replaced the cable with the Fiio cable in discussion, and immediately heard more detail when I hooked them up.  Maybe they fixed some of the issues that folks are complaining about because I have been walking around with them all day and not one noise or bad thump.  They are excellent cables and much better then the originals.  I don't find them to be stiff or cumbersome in any way, and not sure of the sounds others have heard.  My overall assessment of the cable is that they are much better then the originals and have excellent range, and are quiet.",positive

The remote itself is in excellent condition with no marks or scratches although there is no protective plastic on the remote like you would normally find on a brand new one. One thing that was annoying was that there was no manual or set up instructions. Thankfully, I have already owned a Logitech universal remote so I knew that you had to set it up via your computer with the included USB cord. I just think that some sort of instruction paper would be helpful for people who have never owned one of these remotes so they know they have to go to the website to download the software. Other than that, I'm pretty satisfied. Haven't set it up yet but will update my review once I do.",positive

"First off let me say I've been an iPod user for many years. I never even considered other brands when it came to MP3 players. However my back up iPod is having some issues and I decided to try this while I try to get motivated to take it to a Genius.<br />What first caught my attention was the price and the extra micro slot. I've been using the old style clicker wheel players and I didn't even know you could add space. What an awesome feature. The price was right in my budget considering I don't know much it will cost to repair my old one and I need a backup for when my main player freezes up or looses its charge.<br />I wasn't expecting much truthfully.<br />The first thing I tried was the radio. I'm not a fan of the style of ear buds that come with this so I plugged in some others I have. The sound was really rich and no static in the radio. I'll have to try this at my work where signal strength is shoddy. But so far quite impressive.<br />I then went to load the music from my computer. I own a lot of it and doing this manually took at least 3 hours. But it finally was loaded.<br />And here's where the fun began. The included instructions were minimal. I could play something random but the instructions were not clear on how to get to the root list of your songs. I finally got it to pull up but I can't tell you how. The instructions say to push the bottom triangle which is the volume button. And this doesn't do a thing when you push it. Also when you select what you want, you have to hit the menu button which is the top middle button. I'm so used to using the actual middle button as the &#34;ok&#34; or &#34;select&#34; button on pretty much anything electronic, this seemed counter intuitive.<br />I do have a few minor quibbles with this but it's mostly in the instructions and it could stand to be more user friendly. I consider myself pretty knowledgable with computers and I had issues. As far as the player itself, it sounds great. Very lightweight and the purple color I ordered was metallic and very pretty. I think this will work wonderfully as a backup for then I need it. I highly recommend getting the micro SD card for more space. I found one here for less than $7 which made this a very affordable 32 GB player.lor I ordered was metallic and very pretty. I think this will work wonderfully as a backup for then I need it.

"Pros:<br /><br />*I really love the blue color of this particular model, the blue finish doesn't collect fingerprints like some all black or silver matte speakers tend to.<br /><br />*The option to connect with an auxiliary cable directly makes this a fully functioning speaker despite any issues with connectivity or Bluetooth availability.<br /><br />*Speakerphone mode allows you to quickly switch between phone calls and music seamlessly.<br /><br />*The controls are very big and easy to manage and guided by loud voice commands, so you always know what feature you've just engaged (The woman speaking does have a distinct and heavy accent though.) Instructions are included but very brief.<br /><br />*The price for the quality of build here is a big positive- it is heavy in the hand and very sturdy- it does not appear cheaply made, though I wish more design went into the packaging it arrives in. The plain cardboard box isn't very gift impressive.<br /><br />*The speaker itself  is 360 and located near the top of the device so audio transmits in all directions which seems to provide a clearer audio experience than some competitors speakers of similar price and size. At 3 watts the volume of this speaker was very impressive as well, likely thanks to this design. I use this both in and outdoors, including in public places with strong atmospheric sound. The depth of audio and Bass is also fairly impressive for the price rang but not the best clarity of depth compared to other speakers I own.<br /><br />*The limit of Bluetooth connectivity range is very reasonable- I was able to get service and pairing at about 10 feet.<br /><br />*Battery life on full charge for me was almost 5 hours, Bluetooth, at max volume. I seemed to squeak a little more from it when connected by cable. Charge time is about 1 hour and 45 mins-2 hours.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*As many others have mentioned, the connectivity is an issue. If I leave my phone sitting next to the speaker and don't move either I can get hours of sound off the single pairing. However, if the charge of the speaker is low, and or one of the devices are moved I have to re-pair. This is a bit annoying for it being such a slick portable speaker. Considering this into the price, I don't find it that big of a drawback so long as the buyer s aware of this issue going in...however, this probably does not make it best for gifting.<br /><br />*The phone'/speakerphone/calling function picks up a bit of the surrounding noise and is not fit to use in a public setting. I got a small amount of feedback calling in my living room with no surrounding noise. I do not consider it a selling point.<br /><br />*The auxiliary cable did not work with my standard Sansa MP3 player, but did work with my Samsung Galaxy S3.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this speaker is definitely worth the price for an office or other stationery place- it is loud enough to fill an entire living space and the volume is a big selling point. Clarity and range is good so long as you do not plan on moving or using your bluetooth paired device while you listen. The design is slick and the product feels built well, it will not look cheap wherever you choose to use it.either I can get hours of sound off the single pairing.

"few things about me to explain my point: i am a professional artist & A SUPER heavy athlete as i workout 6 times a week (weightlifting + cardio) while music to me is everything as i spend allot to get sound perfections to indulge my senses. I've used Bose, KEF, Beats, Panasonic, Sony, Phillips, Samsung, and plenty more and resided at the perfection that i got from KEF specially the SUPERB KEF X300A Wireless speakers that cuddles my imaginations and never found anything that could beat it till now.  I've searched plenty headphones around that works as sweat proof although i never let any sweat touches neither my nano nor my headphones so to me every headphone on the market works perfect with me IF AND ONLY IF its earphone holds well and stays still IN my ear during my advanced steps aerobic dancing.  This KEF M200 has a SUPERB clarity with base as it's SUPER amazing but as other reviews said &#34;it won't fit my ear&#34; & &#34;my ear hole is too small&#34; as i thought that was ridiculous but unfortunately it is true! although with me there is something different! it fits in perfectly but after a while it simply pops out and i need to push it back in my ear again! and that by itself is distracting if i'm focusing on my workout.  the 2nd drawback is the remote control, for once i thought it was for the volume of my Nano as only the middle button worked fine for forward, pause and rewind the songs and i thought for once that the volume buttons was faulty and didn't work. but right after contacting the seller i found out that this volume control is for the microphone which is a MAJOR drawback as i should increase or decrease the volume of my songs from my Nano and i guess you know already the headache by doing that.  the 3rd drawback, which is not important to most of people that this one is not sweat prof, so the possibility of earphone to stop working is quite high which makes it unreliable for sportive and athletes.  4th is that when i take out the earphones out i feel like i was deaf! and i feel a bit pain in my ears, so it's not a good experience to be honest.  5th: the wire is quite long and it requires a clipper so i can clip it on my clothes rather than hanging.  so in my opinion the best choice for me is the Bose SIE2i Sport Headphones (already reviewed it), but unfortunately even that specific Bose headphone can't last more than a year and half and sometimes 6 months max, as i bought till now 2 pairs, one stopped working and the current one works fine but the control is acting weird! & i just realize that the earphone is sweat proof but the control is NOT which makes it a trick and Bose even tricked us by not stating this clearly.  so i guess my journey remains still for seeking the best earphone that could last more & i wish KEF would take these points into considerations.",positive
"Excellent in my LED flashlight!<br /><br />As a mechanic I use my flashlight all day long. Since I'm not a fan of spending a ton on expensive rechargeable Streamlight ones I'm forced to use ones with replacement batteries.

SO NOT happy and of course the company doesn't give you an option to replace, give your money to a different company!",positive
"I love this speaker, the suction cup on the back is great and for the most part will hold on securely. The speaker is around the size of the opening of a solo cup. The sound quality is great and the speaker is loud. The speaker comes with a charger cord (with no base to plug into the wall) and the charger port is the same as android phones. Also, in the instructions it says that the speaker is only water resistant, not waterproof. Not a big deal to me though because I wasn't planning on dunking it in water, but its a heads up. I got the light blue speaker and the color is very true to the photo. The only real complaint I have is that when the battery on the device is low, about every 15 seconds the speaker will pause the music and make a loud beeping noise, then continue to play the music.",positive
"My son is 8 and they fit his head perfectly.  I had to extend it out a little but he still has room to grow.  The cord is long and would be great for computers or tablets.  We had used these with his iPad at home and he currently has them at school to use on the computer.  I like these for him because they are more comfortable than ear buds and they also seem like they will last a lot longer.<br /><br />The volume works great on both sides and my son can take care of these easily.  They are sturdy without being too bulky, and they aren’t too heavy for him.  They come in a variety of colors, but we opted for red as that can be used for boys or girls and the vibrant color makes them easy to spot.<br /><br />After my son outgrow these I plan on letting my daughter have them.

Update I am improving the rating after I got new ear pieces as a replacement. This is a better design and really fit well. Everything that is said about the looks is true. They are stunning looking and wood does enhance the sound. They sound excellent. My only peeve and this could be a wish list is that I wish the wires were tangle free. Also maybe it's my ear but one piece keeps slipping out from my ear. I don't think they will sustain during a jog or treadmill. Buy it for the sound and looks.,positive

It's like everything was muddy and lows just trample on everything else.<br />After listening for a while, I could kinda get used to the sound. But switching back to any other headphone was a relief.<br />I also really feel the whole &#34;semi-open&#34; headphone idea is a gimmick. You let out sound out, no sound in, and it still feels pretty closed.<br />Oh, and the real deal-breaker is that they hurt my head and would cause a headache shortly after putting them on.<br />I'm sure there are some people out there that might like these, but they were so uncomfortable and they just sounded so 'meh' to me that I couldn't give them a chance.<br />Only good thing I can say about them is the build quality is excellent, as many others have said.",positive

"These are pretty terrible.  They are extra thin compared to a normal microfiber cloth.  I can rub them around on my screen or on my glasses.  And while they do not damage the lenses or the screen. They don't actually do much cleaning either.  It gets some of the surface oil off, but never really gets to where it's optically clear.  At that point it just spreads the oil around and you end up with a mess that requires an actual microfiber cloth. If you keep cleaning with it you can sometimes get it to clear it up. But it takes way more work than your average microfiber cloth.  A microfiber cloth should clean as fast as possible to minimize the rubbing you have to do.  Less rubbing less chance of a scratch.   These maximize the amount of rubbing needed to get the thing clean.   You can get something clean with these, but expect to rub the screen or lens for a minute or 2 before you get it perfect.   i have a microfiber cloth from my eye doctor that cleans in one or 2 rubs.",negative

update 9/2/15. I contacted Bose about possible repair and they said that this damage is not normally covered under warranty but they would make a one time exception. I shipped the broken set back and they sent me a new one. I have added a star back but I will still be watching these things more closely in the future.<br /><br />I loved these things for the 2 weeks I had them.<br />I work in a colo with industrial air handlers and hundreds of servers so the noise makes it very difficult to use the phone. These things block out enough of the background roar that I was able to hear people on the other end of my conversation clearly for the first time ever. Then I snagged the cord on a door handle and it popped right out of the battery housing. 2 weeks and I'm out $250. I highly recommend these for sitting around on an airplane but if you are in a working environment make sure you can protect the cable because it didn't take much. I reached out to a headphone repair shop and they said they couldn't help because the compartment is sealed.,negative

"First of all, the packaging is really nice.  Apparently if you buy electronics and it isn't in a cool package, then it's a cheapie.<br /><br />But of course, it's the product that matters and not the package.  I got these to replace another brand that I ruined.  I do like these very much (although Amazon says, &#34;Love it&#34; for a 5 stars & I wouldn't go that far).  They look good and the sound quality is to my ears is clear and smooth.  The volume adjuster is for me a new feature compared to my previous (and expensive) headphones.<br /><br />The line is quite long and that might be a problem for shorter people.  For me, I like knowing that I can have the phone in my pocket and the cord will not be stretched.  This will be even handier I think when the winter comes and I'm wearing heavy jackets with deep pockets.<br /><br />The main problem is something that others have mentioned.  They can move out of my ears too easily. It comes with other sizes of buds, but when I tried to change them to see if the others fit better, I found that it was really not so easy to do.  I decided to leave the original ones for fear of causing more trouble than what it was worth.

"This is better than the corded version of the same concept: bone conduction. These support two criticial Bluetooth technologies: Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and Hands-Free Profile (HFP), which works on most Bluetooth 2.0 technologies found with newer, as well as older phones.<br /><br />Its microphone is superb, someone who calls you will hear you with crystal clarity. But hearing them is another matter. It's not impossibly bad, you can hear the other person, but in a muted sort of way unless you can put the end right over your ear, which would beat the purpose of this kind of technology. You'd also have to be in a very quiet place to really hear well; like a library. Any ambient noise, such as a relatively quiet fan will make it really difficult to hear.<br /><br />It does fit nicely as designed, and there's some amplification thanks to a re-chargeable AAA battery inserted in a well-designed compartment. It also comes with a fantastic USB charger for both AA and AAA batteries. You can charge two at a time, but you'll need only one for the headset.",negative

"The first day I got this, I plugged in our cable box, our PS4 and our Blu-ray player into this.  I could not get it to switch between them properly.  I found a USB-5v adapter which I plugged into our TV and the HDMI switch.  This helped tremendously.  I was happily using this product for about 3 months with external power -- with the occasionally blanking out of our PS4 that lasted about 5 seconds but always came back.  Now, nothing works.  It switches randomly and I have trouble getting a picture at all.<br /><br />I notice pictures of this exact same case from many manufacturers.

"Whoever came up with the idea to change songs on quick press instead of changing the volume needs to be flogged. Seems that everyone is stupid making these cheap speakers so no deduction for that. I do have issue with the annoying power up/down and connected/disconnected sounds so minus a star there. Another issue is the fact I set this thing up and without touching it the thing decides to bump the volume up. I have even set it to maximum and it still does it. I would gladly blame my Galaxy S4 or the PowerAmp music app but considering my other speaker does not do this I am left to assume it's an issue with this speaker. Lastly I would dock another star for how flimsy the port cover is and how easily it can fall open on it's own making all the IP ratings in the world moot when water gets past it and down the audio or usb jacks. I purchased the Omaker, Mpow, and this Ayfee to decide which would grace my boat. Hands down the Mpow won and this and the Omaker will be going back. Hard to find an &#34;original&#34; on any of these speakers. So many sellers selling the same product with a different name printed on it. Kinda feel it's a crap shoot in your luck and expectations. Take this very speaker as an example. I can find two other companies selling the exact same thing. Re-branding isn't new put is rather off-putting here to me. UPDATE. Well the only speaker that didn't have issues ended up being the Mpow. The Mpow also doesn't skip tracks unless you long press so huge kudos to them for that. I received an email from Ayfee claiming their &#34;Stereo S&#34; was an original model only produced by them yet as I stated before it's obvious re-branding since the others say &#34;Stereo S&#34; on the bottom as well as every other certification they claimed made theirs not a re-brand. The ONLY difference that can be seen on any of these same products are the company names. I do appreciate a seller making a follow up but the mail was so broken english it was hard to read. I don't mind the hard to read but I do mind trying to tell me something so obviously wrong. So another star for that.

So I did a lot of comparison shopping and settled on the Sunlabs 8 slot charger and 8 each of their AA and AAA batteries. Everything worked as expected, fast, the readouts were very cool but...I noticed that slot 3 and slot 8 were much slower on both the AA and AAA sessions. I put all 8 batteries in and slot 3 and 8 took and extra 30 minutes to charge the AA batteries and they never did finish the AAA so I just moved the batteries to different slots and about an hour later they were done. The fact that it took another hour leads me to believe those 2 slots are not working as well as  the other 6. Once I have 2 batteries that need recharging, I am going to test these slots again. I hate it when a product mostly works. So now I have a 75% effective system. I hope other slots don't crash.",negative

"I'm afraid even with 7 sizes of ear buds, they were all too large for my ears. I'm sure they'd be fine if I could get them to stay in my ears.",negative
"I generally don't wear ear buds, mainly because I can't get them to stay in my ear for longer than five seconds. This is especially problematic while working out. So I did some looking and found these, actually I found the OCX 685i, and asked for them as a Christmas gift. The gifter made a mistake and bought these instead, which I'm grateful for. Once properly inserted it's like they are glued on. I have read some reviews where people comment they struggle getting the proper fit the first time, but I find it to be quite easy and obvious. They come with a protective pouch that a year and a half later is holding up beautifully. There is also a small hook included to clean any earwax or skin flaks. It is probably unnecessary seeing as they are water proof, but it's a nice thing to have. After about an hour my ears do start getting fatigued, both my inner ear, and the little conch where the fin rests. Ear buds always stress my inner ear though. As I've said I don't use ear buds often, but the sound on these cannot compare to even my cheapest set of over ear headphones. My roommate and workout buddy bought a pair shortly after I received mine. He promptly threw away all his other ear buds and uses these for everyday music listening, so maybe they sound better? His are still going strong after more than a year of heavy, everyday use and travel. Mine still look like they are brand new. I would like to give them more stars, but the quality of music really is lacking. Maybe I'm just being a brat, but there are certain songs I can't to even listen to on these. Great for a quick workout, but you will never see me using these recreationally.",positive
"It's difficult to find stations, the batteries don't last very long, the ring is small and doesn't detach to hang on something, and it doesn't have a charger or plug.",negative
"I goofed on this one, didn't read well enough. It does not offer a full matrix, you can only switch sources, not fully selectable/splitable. So whatever you select you get on both outputs. NFG dude",negative
"Remote was not new. It was scratched, dirty and sticky. Returned it.",negative
"It's a great little clock radio/ phone charger. I bought it for my wife to use it at work and she loves it. However, it has a limited life span. It charged her iPhone 4 but does not work with her iPhone 5 regardless of the cable or adapter we try. Now I need to find a replacement.",positive
"These headphones are very screechy, I can't listen to them very loudly or it hurts my ears. I've had many other headphones in the 20$-30$ range but nothing as bad as these. Don't buy. It's a waste of money",negative
Something you always want to have. A lot in a small piece.<br />I like the hand crank for instant use.,negative
"Watch out for problems  I bought this receiver because of all the things you can hook up to it, especially the Phono Pre Amp built in. The HDMI pass is nice, except for the wait time between device switching. (Directv/Apple TV)  Suddenly after two years, the sound just stopped working.period ! Called Onkyo support, they said, oh yeah, thats a problem with this unit, send it back to us for repair. I got a shipment box right away from service and a very quick turn around on the repair. Now I have to plug all the connections back in and service reset the settings to factory!!! I have a couple of hours to put all my connections back the way i had them and then set up all my preferences on the menu.  NOT HAPPY !!",positive
"I put this in my bedroom. On average, I get about 10 channels and sometimes 20. I have to move it to another wall near the window then i will get 20 insignificant channels all the time. I don't watch much TV in my bedroom anyway, so it serves the purpose..",positive
"Absolute junk, the directions in the case are not even for the same device, head phones don't work.All round I am sad to say I went cheap and got cheeper.  Paper weight for $30",positive
Had a problem with intermitent female connector. Had to return.,negative
I only used it 3 time to charge my rc car when its just dies.... never buying it again,negative
"Charge is holding fine. Good sound when it works. Had it for two years and it worked fine with my tab for most of it. Now it drops the sound while still showing as connected with my Tab. Both devices confirm it is paired but, the sound just drops after a random time span, usually less than one song..Battery shows as good. Warranty expired but, sound drops at random intervals for no apparent reason. Stopping all other apps and unpairing all other devices didn't solve the problem. This goes for all devices paired with it. At 8 bucks a month for what I got I won't cry a river but, tech support is lacking. Need a proper forum so users can Macgyver a solution once warranty runs out.",negative
"Did not expect the best sounding speaker, but at the price, it is great.",positive
"The sound quality is very nice, but right away, the AUX 1 ports didn't work. I haven't checked out anything else, but I like it so far. I'm guessing the issue is loose wiring because sound pops in and out. I don't plan on putting anything else in AUX, but I suppose it could be a precursor to issues in the future.",positive
"At first I was concerned at the size of it (that's what she said) and it actually turned out sounding remarkably excellent!  It was easy to use, easy to pair with my phone and the fact that it was solar powered made me feel happy that I was able to save a manatee.  It charges my phone while it plays tunes when I'm working outside at the community gardens.",positive
"Made for large strips/blocks, bigger than most I've ever used.  .315 total width of 1 connector",negative
This is a great cable for the money. The drawback relative to higher end cables is it has less shielding and has electrical interference issues (notable being switched fluorescent lighting).,positive
"This product had great reviews so I thought I would get it since I needed a new set of earbuds. I open up the package and am in the process of plugging them into my phone jack when the insulation starts to strip. Then when I attempt to listen to music, one of the rubber ear covers breaks off, also the quality of the sound was lacking. Overall, a terrible product and I was quite disappointed. Thankfully I was able to get a full refund.",negative
The outlet works great and the price is good. Wish the outlet had better spacing.,positive
"Really disappointed in this item. In the picture, it is unclear what those connections are at the bottom. The item description does not detail it, either. It looked to me like USB connections so I bought two of these, for that reason alone. I feel the description was purposefully misleading as it was worded very carefully - in hindsight I can see that the more detailed description mentions &#34;low-end&#34; peripherals but even that is certainly unclear! A 1.0 USB is considered low-end these days.<br /><br />The item name and description need to be changed to reflect that those are merely phone jacks - who uses land lines these days? Okay, I have a landline but I only have 1 jack as I use cordless phones, and I already have that plugged into a battery backup. It will cost as much as the product to try and return it so I now have two over-priced power strips that don't do what I needed them to do and will have to spend additional money to get something that does.",negative
"The sound is good but not amazing, but it works very well for my purposes.  I carry it in a water bottle holder on my bike on long rides.  Many people wear headphones, or just one earbud, but I don't find those to be safe and so I prefer a speaker.  The strength of this speaker is that it is completely rainproof.  I keep my iPhone in a waterproof bag on the bike and play to this speaker over bluetooth.  During a major storm on the GOBA 2015 tour I was rocking out with no worries.",positive
Does the job. I don't know how long it will last but it makes things manageable.,negative
"This turn table is crap. My 33s sounded decent, but my 45s sound like they were being played over a bad radio station. It doesn't have a lever for the arm so you are forced to scratch your vinyl if you want to stop a record early. The records skip like crazy and songs are no longer coherent. It is not worth your money, don't buy. Never even got to the USB capabilities.",negative
"Okay, so let's get this out of the way first. These headphones have some pretty great sound quality when in Bluetooth mode and they definitely last as long as the company claims. The first time I bought this product I was absolutely amazed by how solid they felt and how good the sound was. They can also be super loud when you want them to be in Bluetooth mode and the range in volume is excellent. When you wire them into your computer, they are WAY too loud and could even act as speakers, so I recommend keeping your PC volume at around 10% when wired in. My issue with this product is that the hinges can and will break if you use them actively. The second time I bought this product, they were built much worse and that stained my view on it even more. They did last around 3 months each time, and they'll easily last a year if you rarely swing the cups out. The build quality is all plastic BTW, and the LEDs can get pretty annoying in the dark because you will see them blinking a lot. For sound alone, you won't get any better for the price, but just know that you will have to buy a few of these throughout your lifetime.",positive
Does not work.  Tested with several HDMI sources and different composite input monitors.  No signal delivered to any of them.,negative
it is doing the job I purchased it for. It saves me from doing unnecessary connecting/disconnecting!,positive
Great sound and easy to use.. That's a big bonus for an old guy that is technically inept.,positive
"This is a very high quality made wall mount for a tv. It was easy for my husband to install. Just mount it to the wall, then put your tv on the wall mount and you are done. It took him maybe 30 mins or from start to finish. He loves it he has been wanting a wall mount for our 55 inch flatscreen tv for a while. He loves the fact that you can move the tv from side to side. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.<br />*I was given this product for free/discounted for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own.*",positive
"They were great at first. I followed the directions and got them charged before I turned them on and paired them. Went for a run and after about an hour they stopped playing music and would beep three times then once. They did that over and over I couldn't turn them off. When I got home I put them on the charger and they never lit up put i made sure everything was plugged in and left it for four hours. Tried to turn it on and it wouldn't respond. Tried pairing it would respond. So this product is only good for two hours then throw it away! I did get a refund though, which is nice.",positive
Just okay.  I wouldn't expect anything other than decent headphones.  So these are probably $5 more than they should be for the sound quality.  You won't be disappointed for good ear buds but they wont blow you away.,positive
"Sent it back. Had pops, clicks, and white noise from just plugging it in to my computer and projector. I didn't even have any sound being used, the cable had interference for some reason. Tried it on another machine, same thing happened. Bad quality.",negative
It suxs does not work with seki 4k TV it lies signal all the time,negative
This product has very good sound quality when you want to enable an old stereo or receiver to play airplay.  The only complaint I have is that wifi reception is  a bit on the weak side.  If you are close to your router this system will work well for you.,positive
Holds batteries. Didn't break. Not much to say about it.,positive
"good product, it works very well but it is just so heavy",positive
"EVEN AS CHEAPLY PRICED AS THEY ARE IT'S NOT WORTH THE PRICE!<br />Save you money the sound on these headphones is so incredibly poor, that I dug out an old set and used them instead.",negative
"The repair kit was what I expected, but it turned out that the speakers needed additional repairs, so I returned the product and bought new speakers.  Since I didn't use them, I didn't feel I could evaluate them as to performance.",negative
Was good for a few weeks. Then ONe by one all the LED's died. Would not recommend,positive
"Purchased two back ups and one is working good the other is not at all. This item is not refudable through Amazon, but I email Compucessory and never heard back.<br />In the future I will look to purchase from other sourse as Compucessory doesn't reply to customers questions.",positive
"This product fits, however; it is not as described in the listing.  I mentioned this to the seller but they weren't much help.  My particular order was for a replacement for the xlm II.  What I received was the replacement for the adc rk8e, an inferior stylus vs. the xlm II.  It's low cost, so not much money invested.<br /><br />Do some research if you are looking for the real deal replacement.  This is only good if you have no other option.",positive
"I have used these for running and swimming and the VRX is a great piece of kit. No problems with the fit even semi-sprinting and the sound quality is I would say, the best I have experienced from any sport headphones. What I didn't expect is how effective all the uploadable workouts are. I have done a HIIT running session and a calisthenics session [still stiff from the latter!]. They were awesome. The calisthenic gym session was from a trainer at &#34;Fortress Fitness&#34;. It was just like having someone train me.<br /><br />Swimming is exactly as they say, a little bit of set up putting them into the case and making sure the silicone case is taught and flat against the speakers before putting them against your ears. When you get in the pool though, the bottom line is, it works! There is volume and bass and no messing with the fit. Then I have time notifications throughout. Some thought has gone into these headphones. Every other product with a trainer, links to your phone. This is the only thing out there that doesn't need a phone. 5 star.",positive
It is easy to set up and delivers strong performance for both watching movie and listening music.  It is well-built and super comfortable as it comes with padded ear cushions. I highly recommend buying these. Good value for money!,positive
"I had good luck in the previous Earpollution earbuds I bought from Wal-Mart (they lasted about a year and a half!) So I had high hopes for these.  After just two weeks, the plug is faulty (I have to wiggle the connector to get them to receive sound)  and now have reordered a different brand.  Maybe I just got a bad set - like I said, I loved my previous ones. The sound quality is awesome considering what you pay for them.",negative
"The Soundpeats M20 are a great set of cheap in-ear buds, with sound quality far exceeding their price. The<br /><br />The M20s are packaged in a clear plastic box, reasonable but not great in appearance or quality -- mine arrived somewhat banged-up and dented. Inside, you'll find the earphones along with a baggie of extra tips in various sizes. I found the initial fit good enough that I didn't need to experiment too much with the others, though they're nice to have. The earphones themselves are well-made, light enough to stay in the ear without much fuss. The cable is flat and soft-feeling; the one major problem with it -- and the set as a whole -- is the amount of noise it transmits. Handling the cable or brushing against it at all results in quite a bit of in-ear noise.<br /><br />The sound, though, is impressive for earphones this inexpensive, rivalling sets that cost two or three times as much. I found it satisfyingly bassy and also sharp at the top end, with perhaps a bit of a hole in the lower midrange, though not too bothersome or steep. Everything from vocal and guitar-heavy music to jazz ensembles to hip-hop sounds well defined and surprisingly clear, considering the price.<br /><br />The M20s' sound is really impressive for earphones this inexpensive, and I'd recommend them for any use except exercise, given the slight problem of cord-handling noise.<br /><br />The manufacturer provided a sample for this review.",positive
Note sturdy and easily knock over.  Remote has limited functions.,positive
Worked fairly well for the cost. Charging connection piece broke after 5 months rendering it worthless,negative
"Have been using this for 3 days straight to convert my IQair Healthpro 250. Works fine so far.<br /><br />However, i am giving it 3 stars because the plug outlet doesn't fit well. You can feel some looseness when the plug point is plugged in (as in you can jiggle the plug while it's in the socket).",positive
Fits perfectly in cabinet drawer for minimal clutter.  Goes well with two other smaller Polk speakers on side of TV for a full sound.,positive
Only one sounds as it should.  The other one is very low.  Wasted my money.,negative
"I have to say this is the best product so far that hasn't failed me. Great product to hear music while taking a shower. Great product, the only thing that would make it better is if they enhance the speaker. But I would totally buy it again!",positive
"very disappointed for my first shot at chordless eabuds. I've never hada very hard time with ear buds fitting, but these are the most uncomfortable ones I've worn. got use to them but still not real happy. bought them to use running (3-5 times a week) and at the gym(3-5 x)  work and yard work, there fine if you are just sitting, but when you run (or move the phone much at all) it cuts in and out. to the point when i run it will disconnect. NOT worth it if you are going to want them while being active. mowing the lawn, around the house fine. but not for actually working out or running.",negative
"Do not buy wait your money, when I received and install them into my scooter it say low charge so left in to charge for 12hr and it was say the say thing.

"Thought my issue was initially from my apple device having Bluetooth issues because the sound would just stop. I've had this speaker since 2012 though and quit using it after only a few times. Regardless of the timeframe though, I am using the power cord not batteries, now it connects and I get no sound, period. So I think the few times the sound dropped, perhaps there was an internal issue with the Bluetooth chip on the Creative D100. I've reset things, connected to different devices, no sound period, and this speaker has been just sitting in our home office, not plugged in, nor powered on. So I think the speaker has been the problem all along and sometimes after you troubleshoot it yourself. You just walk away. I've worked with computers for 21 yrs, there isn't much with Bluetooth to troubleshoot and what you do troubleshoot either it works or it doesn't. I have not 1 issue with the other 3 Bluetooth speakers we have; Soundblock, Omaker M4 or Bose sound link. So buy any of those instead, this was just throwing money out the door because my issues started almost immediately. Maybe a bad batch of the D100? Creative products must not be what they used to be...",negative
Using with an iPhone 5s and iPhone 6+ and with both you have to keep extremely still (set the phone down) to get anything to play without cutting out. The farther away you are the more it will cut out of moved. I'm talking within 4 feet too.<br />It's almost pointless to have anymore. Most devices that are connecting via Bluetooth are going to be mobile so this won't work for me.,negative
My husband loves these - can mow the lawn and enjoy listening to his music - the noise cancellation works great,positive
Excellent all-around radio.Unfortunately they didn't do a better job on the  echo. Even with both settings turned all the way down there is still too much echo and or Reverb.I haven't been able to find any upgrades for this issue as of yet.,positive
"These earbuds are great. But not for exercise. These earbuds are perfect for traveling in a car, train, or plane.  They reduce outside noise very well. But for exercise, they block out too much of the environment, making it hard to hear bicyclists or vehicles, while balanced against the volume of the player. They are a tight fit in your ear, perfect for sitting and traveling. When running, that fit rubs in your ear, and as you sweat, becomes ever more loose and irritated, the earbuds won't stay put, sliding out of your ear if you work out longer than 30 minutes.  Do you sweat during your workout? Of course you do. Sweat is bad for the inline switch for pausing your player. While the button is convenient, if you sweat, it will get in the switch, which for me meant a constantly pausing workout, or stoppage of my workout. That sweat, will also disable the switch after a few runs of getting in there. So again, great for something where you are just sitting. Good headphones, just NOT for exercising. I hope this helps.",negative
Absolutely perfect device very fair price quick delivery with excellent warranty.  I'd recommend it to anyone.,positive
"This unit has worked as described.  The only downfall is in the resolution quality options, which don't match the more advanced resolution quality of the TV that is being used for the transfer.",positive
"This Sony boombox quit working after less than a year and it not used that much. Trusted the Sony brand, but this one did not last. The Memorex I currently own has lasted longer. Maybe I got a lemon or the moral is: Brand names cannot be trusted all the time.",negative
"Pros:  Great volume, comes with ear buds, easy to use, good instruction manual, display is easy to read, good radio reception, power saving modes, compact, easy to load music onto SD card and access from there, SD card and regular memory remain separate.  Cons: Button broke easily, difficult to get the SD card to stay in at first, loading songs directly onto mp3 player was difficult due to file types, buttons are hard to work- cannot go backwards or access menu easily because if you hit the control in the wrong place it throws everything off.  Overall it would be a good mp3 player if the buttons didn't break so easily.  In the future I would recommend they rework the central control as it is too finicky. Still it is a nice mp3 and I enjoy mine. *****After writing the above review the MP3 player broke completely.  The company had contacted us and said they'd send a free one in exchange for writing a review.  That was over half a year ago, no new one. No response to emails. The player didn't even last through a dozen uses. Save your money!!!!! This thing is garbage, and it's company hasn't show itself to be any better. :(",positive
"I could not have been more disappointed. This is just black stretchy cloth. In my world speaker cloth does 3 things: 1. PROTECT the speaker it is covering. 2. Look nice. 3. Let the sound through. This product does 2 & 3 and does nothing to protect.<br /><br />Every amplifier, PA speaker cabinet I have ever seen or owned had a speaker grill that would prevent something gauging or poking the speaker. This stuff is like glorified pantyhose.<br /><br />Parts express finally credited me for it after 3 calls. I would do business with them again but this product should be pulled.",negative
Excellent hi-tech item. Completely blocks background noises out. The ear pieces  are very comfortable and the sound just crystal clear. Gives enough bass for maximum joy. I love it. Customer support is excellent.,positive

"Very easy to connect with Bluetooth, Easy to set up and long power cord,<br />DOESN'T HAVE A CHARGING SPOT ON THE TOP, you'll need your own charging cord.",negative
It's good. I purchased 4. The odd thing is that it occasionally doesn't work on both USB charges at one time. We get a message &#34;not charging&#34;. We'll pull out the cord and put it back in a few times then it works. It's a mystery.,positive
"I sought this product because I wanted to eliminate the clutter of remotes on our coffee table.  Equipment: all Sony (TV, BD player, CD changer, and AV receiver) except for my Scientific Atlanta cable box.  I figured that the remote manufacturer I'd have my best chance with was Sony because of my preponderance of Sony equipment.  Well, the devil is always in the details.<br /><br />Sony claims that &#34;the RM-VLZ620 is preset at the factory to operate Sony brand A/V devices ... .&#34;  Well, almost.  I found that I could do everything basic that I wanted to do -- except switch my AV receiver input to &#34;SAT/CAT&#34; -- required to connect my cable box through to my TV.  I can step the switching sequentially by using the remote's INPUT key, but to direct-switch is not documented.<br /><br />Sony says to call 800-822-2217 if you have trouble using the remote with any Sony device.  I did that.  Well, that's the general Sony support number in a far-off land.  I had trouble with the guy's accent.  And he had his volume turned down.  And he was not familiar with either the remote or the AV receiver.  I spent more than an hour with him on the phone.  In the process, he took multiple trips to the &#34;back room,&#34; presumably for consultations.  Finally, I gave up because of his unfamilarity of the products.  In his defense, I must say that Sony AV receiver engineering gets some blame for not assuring interoperability with their remote products.<br /><br />Without documentation of that specific AV receiver switching function, I'll have to resort to trying the remote's &#34;learn&#34; function, something I feel I shouldn't have to do for Sony products.<br /><br />I decided to not return the remote to Amazon.  This is between me and Sony.",positive
"These really do work. They significantly reduce the volume to extremely safe levels. That said, in a noisy environment, they are too quiet. On an airplane, my kids really couldn't hear anything meaningful from their movies. This has also been my experience with other volume limiting headphones.

"I got this clock to replace a 20 year old clock that was working great but I couldn't read the buttons any more so it was getting difficult to set. After reading a LOT of reviews, I settled on this one. I guess I didn't realize that things change in 20 years. When I bought my old one, an alarm clock was made to WAKE YOU!!!<br />  Now, an alarm is not to disturb anyone, I guess, so the sound is very discreet. This clock is great AS A CLOCK ONLY. My dog woke me up this morning & I wondered what's wrong. After a bit I wondered if it was the clock. I held it down by my ear and yes, it was beeping. I had tried it out in the garage the day I got it & I thought it was weak but I figured that in a quiet bedroom it would be OK.<br />  It's not only weak but the sound is on the back, making it worse. I'm very unhappy with this clock & I would return it but I'm crippled somewhat & It's just too hard for me to package & ship back.",positive
"Original BOSE replacement parts? I have my doubts. The labeling and inserts look legit, and to be honest, the build quality is on par with the ear pads that came with my QC15 headphones ... but, if they are original QC15 replacement parts, you would think that they would be an identical size and snap into where the existing ear pads fit. The &#34;ring&#34; that snaps into the headphones is a good 4-5mm smaller on the long side, and 2-3mm smaller on the short side. End result is that these don't snap in place, and fall out when you take the headphones off. First time I've ever left a 1* review. Not a happy customer. Return requested.",positive

Wish they were more comfortable on the ears but work well other than that. I would find some with bigger ear pads next time but they work find.,positive
"Shipped fast. Works alright, but it does distort the sound a little bit. Not quite as good as I'd hoped, but does accomplish what I needed and it's also a good price.",positive
"Piece of crap cables. Distorted sound after a month. Snow on the screen. Used to be great quality, not anymore. Every single one does the same thing.",positive
"I love the size of this and convenience. What I do not love is it isn't that loud. I like to play my music loud, esp. if I am  outside gatdening, but the speaker isn't loud enough and no way I know of  to improve it. I bought two of them. I haven't used the other one yet and hope I can sync them together so it will be louder.",positive
"Great for music (5 stars) I'm giving 3 stars due to fact that it says noise isolating.  They don't isolate anything.  It plays music way better than any beats by Dre does hands down, but if you're looking for something that can help reduce outside noise, these are not them.",positive
Won't transmit picture at 1440P and 60Hz.  Might work at 30Hz or lower resolution.,negative
"Very good looking. Bluetooth sync is just as good as the cable. Extremely comfortable and the only downside is that the sound quality is average. I would recommend this product for people who  like to listen to music alot and take their headphones everywhere, not computer techies.",positive
"Puts out 4k@60Hz, so it's definitely HDMI 2.0. I was concerned it wasn't because of the low price, but it works.",positive
My TV has 3 HDMI ports and whenever I do use it it works perfectly. I have it hooked up to my Bluray & Cable box. I usually watch cable or my Fire TV Stick but it's good to know that it's there and I don't have to fumble around with the HDMI cords when I'm ready to watch a Bluray DVD.,positive
they get great sound quality and they are more affordable than Beats or Bose headsets,positive

"when these came they sounded terrible and made everything sound like a recording. I didn't mind it case i had already paid for them. Not even 2 weeks from when i got them, the right earbud went out. There not the best but if you don't care then get them",negative
"For the price you're paying, you're probably not going to get much better quality than this, that said, there are a few issues, namely, no volume control on the headset itself, sometimes sound is a little weird til you tinker with the cord.",positive
Doesn't change automatically when shut off a device as stated. It's annoying to get up to change it. Defeats the purpose,positive
Bought these and loved them but microphone busted within 4 months and static started around same time.  Not worth the money,positive
Didnt even fit my powerbeats 2 wirless in-ear headphone and amazon asked me to bundle them pretty upset,positive
Not good cause my TV to short circuit had to replace TV,positive
This unit did not work.  Signal strength was the same with the switch on or off. Even changing the batteries did not make a difference.  Finally I became so disgusted with it that I threw the unit in the trash.  Too much trouble to send it back to China.,negative
Within days of putting in the replacement lamp it started going out again. Had to replace again. Not very happy.,positive
"There is a lot to like about this Mp3 player:<br /><br />1.  32GB of storage holds a lot of music and audio books.<br /><br />2.  The sound quality and volume control are excellent<br /><br />3.  Sleek appearance<br /><br />My player is loaded with audio books  that I listen to at the gym. I enjoy being read to more than listening to music when working out.<br /><br />The only micro USB cable that works with the player is the one that comes with it, or one like it from a similar Mp3 player. It is both a data cable and a charging cable. The micro USB port on the player is purposely made a bit different than the micro USB port on phones and headphones, etc., so that you can't try to use a charging cable for another device and find that you can charge but can't load the player with books or music.  Charging cables have 2 wires, data cables have 4.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the battery life, at least on mine, is terrible.  A full charge lasts no more than 1 hour.<br /><br />To test the battery life for my review, I charged the player, turned it on and played an audio book.  About 45 minutes later, it shut down because the battery was dead.  I again charged the battery and played an audio book.  This time it shut down in about 1 hour.<br /><br />The earbuds that come with the player are too big for my ears, but I have others to use in their place and the User Guide is of only limited help, so expect some trial and error working it out.  But those are nits.<br /><br />The reason I am giving the player 3 stars is  because I must charge it daily to have it ready for the next day's hour at the gym.<br /><br />Sample provided at reduced price for purpose of review.",positive
"Easy to put together. To install center brace, put one end in the center then push/pull back on the frame to have the other end drop into the middle where it is supposed to go. I get a great picture from my Optima HD25-LV. This is my first projector/install and it went pretty easy. The picture looks great.",positive
Absolutely no low end sound even when inserted properly,negative
"This DOES NOT Perform as is promised Signals do not carry, and booster is worthless.  It is a waste of money! Do Not Buy it.  Go with a Cat6 and Network Extender Setup...",positive
Seems to be a great replacement for the original Apple iPhone cord! Sturdy and great length.,positive
"I use these for my in ear rig and they are very good for the money.  A bit on the thin side, but an eq adjustment and I'm game. I am still getting used to how they feel with the offset as they're fitted into molds.  But so far so good and these are very clear.",positive
I bought these thinking it was going to actually keep outside noise quiet but it was not what I was expecting I have some sony extra bass earbuds and they fit great but I really don't hear the difference not in sound or sound isolation I actually think the regular ear buds that come with it are better in my opinion these are not worth $20 I really expected more all I can say is they are comfortable but for me it did not improve sound or sound isolation,positive
Solid. Easy to install.  Four sets of variable screws provided for your tv.<br />cons: horrible tiny spanner provided for the bolts to be installing in the wall.,positive
It is piece of junk and heading for the trash can.  It is a very poor excuse for the Apple equivalent,negative
"While they look good, they don't last as long.  The apple headphones have more durability.",positive
Plugged it in at the Mariott in London... We tried several outlets.  The red light didn't come on.  Worked perfectly in Paris.,positive
"Beware, description says 15watt, manual says 6watts. Very disappointed.",negative
"I had high hopes for this product based upon the write-up. My biggest let down was the documentation for it. Very little detailed info on many levels like supported formats, max size of micro-sd card allowed, moving between functions was not easy (for me). I am no computer wiz but I'm not completely illiterate either. Better user manual would help and maybe some on screen buttons would have helped to make it easier to navigate. I have never done well with 3 buttons doing 30 things depending on the order they were pushed. I believe there are less expensive and more user friendly options in the marketplace. Just sayin'",positive
Works great once on but so difficult to remove. I ended up scratches parts of my railing trying to remove these things. They do however protect really well from the heat of the rifle. Only other complaint is that the long piece should be broken into the smaller pieces so you have more options.,negative
These are unbelievable they hold a charge sooo long.,positive
"Music sounded decent. Charger worked well, even with a fairly bulky case. Numbers on the clock became unreadable within the first year. I can't tell if it's 8:00 or 9:18. Almost every place in ever digit is hard to see.",negative
"I bought them nearly a year ago and barely use them for anything other than travel. I wish I would have read the 1 star reviews before I bought these. Who knew the case would take up so much space in my bag.  Besides that I have horrible static and my cord stopped working for no good reason. I'm left with a huge pair of headsets I can't use.. I wrote the company to see about having them replaced buy after I was told I had to pay the shipping both ways, I'm like well, I can just get a newer, better pair with another company. One day I'l just break down and by Bose or Beats. I've spent way too much money on headsets. Ugh.",positive
"I review this before, but it seemed to &#34;disappear&#34;. The company saw the review and offered to send me another one. They did and it was just like the first one. Both charge to about 70-75% and that is it and they discharge very fast. I do appreciate that they tried to remedy the matter, but they are just faulty. I am using my direct plug in energizer charger that I should have stayed with in the first place. It was just that it is pretty old and I thought a new one especially one that would discharge the batteries (it did not do that either) and then fully charge would add life to the batteries. Simple items usually do better anyway. I am going to buy a new energizer charger like the one I use when I find one.",positive
"Quality is what I expected, it was fine. Mine was only 48&#34; wide not the 54&#34; as advertised. Not wide enough for my project!",negative
this remote is very close to the one we had (lost?) but I like the idea of the keyboard. We've struggled some with it and not sure if it's a battery issue. You know we have the drawer of batteries you never know if they're good or not!? It works for a bit then seems to no work.  if this continues to work fully... we love it. and I will update.  Shipping was fast and prompt (we have prime) so NO COMPLAINTS... we have Netflix usage again!,positive
"Okay, so I really loved my headphones for a long time after getting them. No more tangled chords! And despite some other reviewers, I didn't have a problem pairing with either my phone or tablet, or both at the same time. My problem arose from apparently well-documented flawed construction. After about five months of regular use (5 days a week through almost my entire work day) the plastic headband on mine also snapped, but I managed to save it with super glue. Not exactly ideal, though. Then I started having issues with the buttons like a ton of other customers. Now when I CAN turn it on, and when I CAN connect to my phone, there is no music to be heard, even though the headphone voice claimed the &#34;device connected.&#34; Vexing.<br />So it seems like mine lasted a great deal longer than a lot of other reviews before succumbing to its apparent design flaws.",negative
I was concerned with the battery's arrived with almost no charge... 7-8 hours latter they were fully charged.  Now however I am hard pressed to get 8 miles out of a charge.  Not enough for my 9.5 mile commute.  Probably would not buy again.,positive
"I felt compelled to write this review because I was almost put off by the reviews below writing this off because it sits unevenly. I received my Razer headphone stand a couple of days ago and it's not uneven at all! It's completely even. I don't know if the other reviewerrrs got one from a bad batch or what but my impression is when I hold it, it has a good amount of heft and is clearly quality-machined and designed, and is very good quality. I am legitimately obsessive compulsive and I have even tried to make it wobble or sit unevenly even a little and it just doesn't. The only con to this item is the price, but hey, I love Razer and this is a great stand.",positive
"Batteries don't fully charge or hold a charge for very long. Waste of money, don't buy.",negative
"This is a great bluetooth speaker.  I already own a few others and bought this because it was rated as the &#34;loudest,&#34; which I needed for giving presentations to large audience.  It sounds great, but it is not nearly as loud as my Marley Get Together.",positive
Only I will said to any person who wants by this product don't purchase<br />this piece of garbage is only to put in the trash<br />I lost my money can't return past to much time from the date went I purchase,negative
"Why you selling product that works just for only one program, but sadden stopped working and this thing becomes very hot? I can't send back because it does not worth my time and money.",negative
"Great product and solidly built. I have it installed on an hidden rafter beam just under the eave of my roof. The &#34;U&#34; shape allowed for easy installation with the main tube pointing up above my roof level. I then added about 4 feet of PVC pipe into the tube, capped the PVC tube, and mounted a 2M / 7cm dual antenna on it. Works great and was exactly what I needed. Have now had installed for the last 1.5+ years and is very stable and strong, even in gusty winds.",positive
"A new SoundLink around-ear headphone II will be available from Bose on 9/10/2015. Today I stopped by the local Bose showcase store and tried these new headphones which will replace the AE2w, black w/BT module. The new ones feel much more comfortable because they cover your entire ears. They also include NFC connectivity for those Android devices.  Sound quality was just a bit better then the on-ear version, probably because the ear cups are exactly like the QC25 where they are angled inside. They don't have noise cancelation but reduce outside noise well since they cover your ears. In my opinion the new SoundLink around-ear headphones are the ones to get.",negative
"Only bad thing so far it's inability to block AirPlay devices, anyone in network can turn it on and crank the sound to a max, imagine pranksters doing this at 3 AM ... and the amp is loud , very loud. Apparently the next model has a passcode for each device, why not apply it to this model, is a software matter and can be integrated in a update. Spoked with customer service and they just said it will not be done, just their way to sell the next one.",negative
"I picked up 5 of these to put on my sim racing rig to run with SimVibe for added feedback, and they are definitely impressive. I'm running them from three Dual XPE2700 car amplifiers with about 1/2 of their max gain, so they're a tad underpowered but still managed to shake things up plenty bit. They are much bigger than I anticipated, even after reading the description.",positive
"Only had a DVI port left on my graphics card and the monitor only had a HDMI port, so this cable solved that problem and it works great with Windows 7.",positive
These speakers sound great and have a long battery life BUT the B channel speaker drops the sound for a second or two every couple of songs and is annoying.,positive
"Good noise canceling capability, comparable to Bose QC25.  Not comfortable - tight on ears and heavy by comparison of others Bose, beats, etc",positive
"excellent choice for my smart tv very useful for game consoles and cable TV boxes, also the possibility to hide the wires 99%",positive
battery does not last long a pain to keep it in batterys,negative
The headphones are Great. I do not recommend them for adults they are kind of small. They fit perfect on a child's sized head.,positive
"I bough the Sony MDR1ABT/S Hi-Res Bluetooth Stereo Over-Ear Headphones about a month ago.<br /><br />My uses: Windows 8.1 Pro 64, Windows 10 Pro 64, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPad Air.<br /><br />They're comfortable but they won't be if you have large ears.<br />From what I can see I have mid-sized ears; not small, not giant.<br />An these fit over my ears *CLOSELY*.<br /><br />If you wear them for a few hours they get hot and the skin around your ears will sweat.<br />For $ 400 USD you'd think Sony could spend at least $ 100 USD to<br />create the over the ear pads so that they don't make your head sweat.<br />Minus a half a star on the review.<br /><br />They charge fairly rapidly and hold the charge for a surprisingly LONG time! I like that.<br /><br />What I do NOT like is that they crackle when I use them with my Windows PC.<br />Again, for $ 400 USD you'd think Sony could spend at least $ 100 USD on<br />a good radio to connect with Windows clearly.<br />Minus a full star on the review.<br /><br />I've used them with Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit. And now<br />I use them with Windows 10 on the same computer.<br />In both cases the sound crackles lightly--but very annoyingly.<br />They just shouldn't crackle--especially not at $ 400 USD.<br /><br />I have a very leading edge Asus Rampage V Extreme motherboard with<br />an external Bluetooth antenna that I can move around on my desk--and it's<br />always about two feet to three feet away from me. No matter where I put<br />the antenna I always get crackling noise listening to music, on Skype and<br />watching movies on Netflix, Amazon, DVD and Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The way I know the difference is they do NOT crackly on my iPhone 6 plus, nor<br />do they crackly on my iPad Air. Both of those have a good<br />clear connection to the headset every time.<br /><br />And it doesn't matter if they're fully or partially charged.<br />They crackle on Windows.<br /><br />The other thing that surprised me was the quality of the cover forthe USB charging<br />connection jack. If you get these you'll see why. You need to be careful with this little<br />delicate thing that will probably break very soon. It's tiny, flimsy and doesn't match the<br />overall build quality of this headset. Here's another place where Sony could have gone<br />wild and spent more than 23 cents on a component. This cover really is surprisingly cheap!<br />Minus a quarter star on the review.<br /><br />If you use a Windows PC and also use an iPhone, once you connect them to both devices you can watch a movie, or Skype and if your phone rings you can answer it. Besides the quality and looks, that's why I bought these headphones.<br /><br />However, if you take them off charging you'll need to reconnect them to both again.<br />Minus a quarter star on the review.<br /><br />I've forgotten that and while using Skype, or studying Mixergy or other videos, or watching a movie--the phone will ring and I cannot answer with the headphones if I didn't remember to connect the headphones to the phone again. I know that is obvious, but it would be much nicer if the headphones would automatically re-connect to devices they've been paired with, and connected to--once you're done charging them.<br /><br />Maybe automatically connecting is not a Bluetooth thing yet--I don't know.<br /><br />Other than that these headphones fit and adjust great--and they look really, really nice.",positive
"Received product as expected. However, I needed to use the 200x200 mounting with the M6 screws. A surprise to me that none of the drilled holes for the 200x200 mounting were drilled out for the M6 screws (which were provided with it). I had to drill out the holes that were meant for an M5 screw for the M6 mounting screws. I could accept it easier if the unit was made in China, but it manufactured in Taiwan. I always thought that they had better quality control on their products.",negative
These did not work for me. One of the speakers stopped working after 4 weeks of use (luckily just within the amazon 30 day return timeframe). I may have received a dud. Return was easy with amazon.,positive
"The device worked fine for a few times, then the screen began to intermittently go black  (2 or 3 seconds every couple of minutes).  I liked the product idea, only if quality/reliability was improved.",positive
Not sure about this product. Sound is very good but cuts in and out. I have an iPhone 4s so maybe it's my version of Bluetooth. Will return it if I can't get it to work consistently.,positive
"They were ok whilst working but they didn't last long, ~50 charges.",positive
"This cable worked fine for about three months, but now it's staticky and cuts out.  I spent more on this one because I figured it would be sturdier than the super cheap ones I'd bought previously, but those lasted way longer than this one before dying.  One extra star because I like that it doesn't tangle.",negative
Fast delivery. Great quality sound. Can travel anywhere with it. Very satisfied.,positive
"They are amazing! Love the sound of them, super loud, great base and treble. The reason I did not give 5 starts is because the aux cable that came with the beats don't work properly. I talked to the sellers they did not replace the cable but put me to do the work to search for an aux cable myself on amazon and paid me back the amount of the aux cable I bought. Had to buy black ones cause there were no original blue aux beats for sell.",positive
"Too tight on the head, really bad for anyone wears glasses which makes your ears hurt",negative
Worked perfectly for the old Dell PC that we dug out of the closet!,positive
"These are a backup for my Westone in-ear monitors, so I wasn't expecting spectacular. They sound ok, not great but ok. The biggest problem I have is they don't fit my ears very well. I tried several ear pads, but it seems to be the ear piece itself. It hits on a bony part of my ear so, it hurts after a few minutes. I try to use these for listening to music and podcasts before I go to sleep. If I fall asleep with them, I have a big earache!",positive
"I bought this for the large number display, and that part is great. However, the radio reception and speakers are terrible, and all I heard for two mornings in a row was static. In fact, I didn't even hear it the first morning at all. My spouse had to nudge me, and thank goodness I used my cell phone as a back-up alarm. So don't buy this product thinking the radio part will be good. It sucks. If you only want it for a large number display or buzzer alarm, this would be good for you. I ended up buying a different one for myself, and like it a lot better. I will use this one in our spare bedroom just for the clock.",positive
"After reading the reviews and product  specs, I decided to buy these to use at work.  I found them to be surprisingly ineffective.  I returned them and ended up buying those three dollar foam earplugs and am much more satified.",negative
I have enjoyed these headphones! The sound is great and it isolates noise really well. I walk to work and one time a firetruck passed by with its sirens on! I had to remove the headphones to hear the sirens. It does not look bad either and they are quite comfortable! I would recommend these for anybody!,positive
This battery lasted me maybe 2 weeks as the prior one i purchased from wal mart lasted 6 months. Do not purchase batteries from this site!,positive
I have a small head and have trouble keeping it on my head.  Have to sit very still or it falls off.,negative
It did not work .  I am a TV technician i know it does not work.,positive
"This did not work right out of the box.  It is the third one my dad has owned, so we know how to operate it.  It was delivered on time and packaged well.  Don't waste your money.  It is just not worth the money.",positive
"cheap cheap headphones, that may need time to break in. they are a bit harsh on the high end, but clear. lack bass.",positive
"The unit did not work out of the box.  This is not what I was wanting installing it in my cabin 100 miles from home.  Once I determined it was the problem, I installed a replacement RCA amplifier unit from a local hardware store and successfully picked up 23 channels.  I am not sure how a functioning Channel Master would have performed, but after failing once 100 miles from home, I wasn't going to give it another channel.  Once again, Amazon's return policy was quick, easy, and very much appreciated!",negative
I put this power strip under my desk at work after I was tired of the cleaning crew hitting the power button on my old plug strip with their vacuum cleaners. This plug strip &#34;hides&#34; the power button on the end so it's much more difficult to accidentally kick it.<br /><br />I try to write helpful reviews so comment or vote yes if you think this review helped you in your decision to buy.,positive
Works good. Only had a few chances to try it out. Fast shipping,positive
There is a humming noise in both speakers. This noise depends on how much I turn up the volume on the speakers.,positive
The part did not fit into tv. I had to swap the bulb out to make it fit back into my tv.,negative
After getting these I prefer the original remote better. this one has less functions and some buttons are near fast forward that take you back to live tv I end up pressing them often and have to get myself back into the recording I was watching. It's a hassle in the dark.,positive
"The sound quality of these is good, but the covers purple parts fall off wayyyy too easily. At least once a day, when I take them out of my pockets or purse, one of them flies off. Usually I notice and can retrieve it, but within the first few weeks of buying these, I had already permanently lost the left and right ones that fit my ears the best.<br /><br />It comes with two sizes of buds, so you can use the other sized buds as &#34;spares,&#34; but these headphones would be a lot better if the purple parts didn't come off so easily. It seems that the large-sized ones are a bit more secure, but they still fall off too often. So far I've been lucky and found the missing one again a day or two later, but I'd guess I only have a month or so more of use before I lose one more and these earbuds become unuseable. Without the covers, the sound quality is poor and they fall out very easily. I noticed that on Amazon you can buy replacement covers, but the price is about the same as buying a whole new set.<br /><br />If it weren't for this major flaw, these would be a real winning set of headphones-- they never fall out, they sound good, and the microphone is good (it is quite far away from your mouth, but no one has ever complained that it was hard to hear), and they are very reasonably priced.",positive
Antenna works great but the adhesive squares don't hold the antenna to the window.,positive
"This is not a bad player, if just want to listen to a LOT (16GB) without playlists, which is a must-have feature for me and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.. It doesn't sync with Windows Media Player, however I think there might be a way to load your music to get around that. It does have a pretty good sound quality and the price is nice. I really don't think anyone will be disappointed, if they purchase this. I gave this to my nephew, who said it is a good place to hide his porno from his mom",negative
These were super big. I ended up using the AM20-Black Universal Home Theater mounts since they look nicer. Maybe if I had heavy speakers I would have used these.,positive
Battery lasts very well. Sound quality is what you'd expect from a small portable speaker.,negative
"Bracket was packaged from manufacturer with wrong mounting brackets. Took additional 2 weeks to receive, however bracket is now installed works great.",positive
This does NOT look like the picture. The green is not vibrant. It is a dull boring clear green. It does not react to uv light. The only reason it gets two stars is because it actually works as a sata cable.,negative
Volume control is a slider which does not control the volume on your iphone or ipad. Also there is no forward/backward functionality of the play/answer button.,negative
You need to make sure your stud location will work with this product.  Mine was also missing all of the hardware.,negative
They worked fine...until a few days after the return period ended. Then they convenintly stopped working! Very disappointed!,negative
Build quality/appearance is GREAT; packaging was GREAT; delivery time was GREAT. How does it sound? You guessed it; GREAT!,positive
Product is totally made in China. Packaging feels cheap and product isn't marvellous to set at a prior discount price of $200+. A waste of time and money.,positive
"The sound quality is good, but you can also hear everything the cords touch- which can make your listening experience quite loud.",positive
It's ok. The other person really can't hear that well so you have to turn up the music/video. But thats what you get when it's a dollar.,positive
It works very well however I would buy more batteries to go with it because it seems like some of the batteries could be faulty.  Have had to throw a few away since they didn't take a charge and it was no fault of the charger.  Other than that the charger itself works great,positive
"Ridiculously obscure charging port. Probably will return because I need to keep the charging cable wrapped on the earphone so I don't have to go through the process of hooking it up each time. Granted I am a senior citizen, but there are a few of us out there.",negative
"This was a gift for a guy in my life who I had NO idea what to buy him. His car radio doesn't work that great and he's always by himself working, so I thought this would be a nice change from his headphones. I figured it would be more safe as well - headphones can block out cautionary noises and it can also damage hearing. He loves it. He has had it for a few months now and it's held up well in a fairly rough environment. It charges quickly and the battery lasts quite a while.",positive
"Worked just fine for about 2 months then it just stopped. Contacted Keedox support as it was within the warranty period. They said I had to take pictures of the device showing the switch settings and of the back of the TV where the device was plugged in and the TV screen with the device hooked up and then another pic of the TV screen showing that some other input was working. I understand that all support people have to start with the, &#34;Is the device plugged in,&#34; question, but in this case I had clearly stated that the device worked fine and then it didn't. I started taking the pics and realized by the time I got through with all the configurations and taking all the shots and attaching them to an email and describing what each shot showed, I'd have at least an hour into the process. I figure my time is worth way more than the $38 I paid so I'm throwing the thing out and buying a different brand.",negative
Product didn't work and it was a gift to a friend so wasn't able to return it on time for a refund:(,negative
"For the price, these are absolutely amazing wall mounts. Excellent quality and straight-forward install.",positive
"These earbuds worked great for about a year but now the right side has no sound.  For the price, I would expect them to work for much longer.  The main reason I purchased these was their compatibility with my iPhone.  I purchased a much cheaper pair of Symphonized ear buds, around the same time, for my Android tablet and they continue to work just fine and sound just as good as well.  So, save your money and purchase something cheaper since I could have purchased 5 pairs of the Symphonized for one of these.",positive
Exactly as described. Price and quality is perfect.,positive
"Sometimes cheap things may be good, but most time they just waste money. I just used it twice and now it goes dead. This kind of interface is too loose. You cannot make it a better insert to whatever computer or chargers.",negative
"Excellent customer service, unfortunately the device I was attempting to connect was too old for my Mac's OS to recognize. Hopefully I can find a replacement, from Apple's list, and actually use the cable.",positive
Battery was ordered 7/27/15 and arrived 8/1/15.  Was in good condition; works fine; price was very reasonable.,positive
"You get what you pay for !! Says it's rated for 110lbs, -  NOPE - . My 55&#34; TV is 60lbs and will not sit flat.<br />The weight of the tv makes the top come off the wall. NOT HAPPY",positive
Worked great for about five months of three day a week use. Developed a short and drove me crazy trying to line it up exactly to get it to work one more shift! Annoying and frustrating.,positive
"After I wrote my first review, there seemed to be a problem with the right earbud. It would cut out often for no reason and worked very rarely. I opened it up to find that a wire had broken! Very poor quality, only lasted about a couple of months with minimal wear and tear.",negative
I'm not a fan of these.  I like to have an inline volume control on the cord and I didn't realize this doesn't have any volume control on it.  Not the headset's fault - I missed it in the description.  Otherwise they are okay.,negative
"Works as described and would believe its 200 ties. Yes, they are 8&#34; and are heavy duty. However, the container they came in smelled like melted rubber, same did the ties. Only Complaint",negative

Individual  sockets all so loos that it comes out of the wall plate,positive
Careful if you want to return it need 6$ for drop off in ups,positive
Got this like 3 months ago and it started to rip by where the ear bud cords first separate and the quality is decent,positive
I may have gotten a defective unit but it only get an intermittent signal.  I was going to return for another one but I missed the return deadline date.  Due to the inexpensive cost I may order just to see if the one I had was defective or if its just a bad products all together.,negative
They did not stay on when running they are to heavy on the side with the mic,positive
"I purchased 4 of these, 3 work great, 1 was defective.  Used multimeter to check current, determined it was a defective on/off switch connection.  I don't know if this is an issue others have encountered but I am posting just in case.  Super cheap so you GWYPF.",positive
"I make a lot of movies for my business...  I have used this DVD many times... BUT...<br />the last order I got, 10 of the 25 disk would not record correctly.  I have used this product for 4 years now,<br />and never had any trouble.  Hope manufacturer fixes there current problem.",negative
Pictures show two outlets always on but shipped units have all outlets switched not as advertised,positive
"I expected great things when I got these. I am a frequent flyer looking for peace and quiet while in the air. I am somewhat disappointed that the sound quality doesn't measure up to other buds I have gotten. I have had two pairs of Bob Marley's and honestly, like those better for sound quality and noise isolation. Also the Marley cords were wrapped. These cords, at least for me, are the type that pull the internal wiring from the terminals and kill the buds. I hope this won't be the case. I DO like the way the buds fit the ears. I am also disappointed that there is no volume control on the cord. I didn't realize that before I bought them.",negative
I've gone through a few pairs of these. Why would I keep going back to a set of headphones that break. Well the quality of sound is great for the price while they last. Headphone socket area came apart and had to throw them out my last pair.,positive
"There are tabs on the inside back of the plate that hold the screws. Not a bad idea, but badly executed. If you use an old work box, there are flanges on the box that lie against the drywall, and the box sticks out from the wall just a little bit (the width of the flange). The tabs on the inside back of the wall plate rest against the flange of the box, and stop the plate from resting flush against the wall. The only solution is to break off the tabs with a pliers.<br />I got another one that had the Decora plate. It was better made and did not have the problem with the tabs. If the drywall gets damaged I will be able to by a larger plate (just the plate, not the connectors) at the local box store for a buck or two. So, get the Decora version.",negative
"Thank you Kirin!!! FINALLY a 6ft. cable that ACTUALLY WORKS! Its been hit and miss with other sellers in terms of it actually charging my tablet, but that lovely lightening bold appeared on my battery icon the second I plugged it in! The rubberized feeling to the cord makes it feel heavy duty, and with the longer length, I can slip my extension cord under the couch and sit in any position and not feel that &#34;end of the rope&#34; tug!",positive
Can't get the bluetooth to pair.  It paired initially however now it won't.  Have tried and tried with no luck.,negative
Ordered to use on a flight to watch a movie. Plugged in to get started and only one of the ear jack plugs worked. Pretty disappointing.,negative
Works as advertized. Bass gets better when used underwater.,positive
"My original review is below, it was one star, and I'm moving to 3 just because the customer service with Ohm is great. They sent me a second unit, free of charge, it actually does perform much better than the first one, but it's still not playing the full range of sound from my music, songs where the music pans from left to ring lose notes inside of certain ranges on the pan and I'm thoroughly underwhelmed by the bass, though it does make a difference where you have the speaker. Testing the new one out in the shower the day after receiving it, gave me a noticeable difference in resonation from the low tones than the first unit. However, I went ahead and bought another of the monster speakers I had previously and you can hear the difference with ease.<br /><br />There are better speakers in this price range, but if you get this one and you're not an audiophile you won't be disappointed and the fact that it's waterproof is very nice.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br />I have absolutely no idea where all the positive reviews come from for this thing, it's terrible. Being water resistant doesn't make for the horrid sound, the goofy design, or the fact that it's a mono system, meaning you don't get the left/right audio experience, tons of songs only play parts of certain melodies because hey, who actually listens to their music right? I'm so irritated I bought this based on these reviews I have no accurate words to describe the feeling. There are easily a dozen other bluetooth speakers in the same price range with genuinely impressive sound output as well as full stereo functionality. The monster bluetooth speaker I had before this was phenomenal (it seems to have disappeared and I figured &#34;hey I'll try something else&#34;) and I got it for 30$s, before that the little collapsible ball speaker I had didn't just look cool, and feature the ability to link multiples together for even more impressive sound, it was louder and more comprehensive in audio range than this at like 23$s, it was just fragile.<br /><br />I not only cannot suggest this product, I advise you look elsewhere, unless you just /want/ to pay for a subpar product.his at like 23$s, it was just fragile.

"I cut the cord a while ago with cable but the NFL is back and I wanted CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX.  I get all of them in perfect clarity with 30 some odd other random channels that can be entertaining.  I think this is perfect if that's all you're looking for.<br /><br />Oh and my house if from 1928, and the walls are rock solid.  I have this on the first floor about 5 feet from the nearest window just standing there next to my PS4 and it's clear as day.  I didn't have to try and turn it east/west or shoot lightning at it with a Tesla Coil to get a proper signal.<br /><br />I just plugged it in, ran the channel scan, and a few minutes later it worked.<br /><br />I used this before i purchased http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/dtvmaps/<br />It's a 25 mile HD antenna and i'm 15 miles from the signal so make sure you check that first.<br /><br />Good luck!",positive
This switcher works pretty good.  It doesnt always switch automatically which is my only complaint,positive
"I really like this speaker. It's small, compact, and rugged. Seems like I can take it anywhere. I wish it were a bit louder, although the sound quality is great, I just imagined it would have more boom. But it is worth the money! Another note on the volume: some speakers/headphones have their own volume setting, this speaker pairs with your phone's volume so that your phone can adjust the volume. This can be convenient, but it also means there's a smaller range of volume.",positive
"They are comfortable and isolate noise well, but they are expensive and don't last very long.",positive
"Compact, sturdy and easy to set up.  This bracket is nice for all new light weight LED or LCD TV.  It mounts flush to the wall.  Comes with enough hardware for mounting the TV and installing the bracket to the wall.  Only negative comment would be the screw that secures the TV bracket to the wall mount.  The securing screw will be hidden deep behind the TV so it is difficult to get to.",positive
Housing would not fit into the TV had to remove bulb from housing and rebuild old unit to make it work.  Was not an exact match for the original part.,negative

I only pick up 2 channels with this antenna.  Even after moving to different locations and re scanning channels... :(,negative
"It's great for the price. I would've given it 5 stars, it they lasted longer. I tend to buy one of these every year to every other year, but still a good deal for the price!",positive
This did not fit at all -even though it was listed as fitting the camera I had.  I kept it rather than return it because of postage cost.,negative
somehow it didnt fit my ear... also it doesnt have proper make to stay on ear while running...<br />Went for different brand.. sound Quality was ok...,positive

a little over kill for what i needed but works well.,negative
We had this for 8 months in the before it was no longer usable. As other reviews state the charging port it horrible. We used this the speaker in our boat but it was never submerged. One day the volume wouldn't turn up any louder than a whisper. Spend your money else where.,negative
It only has 5 foot range before losing sync. CRAP!!!.,negative
"After just a few weeks the tape deck stopped working. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to return it under Amazon's return policy which is limited to just a month, so now I'm stuck with a product I was only able to use for three weeks.",negative
Ordered this unit to extend my remote control to outside.  First unit wouldn't work because the receiver LED is on ALL the time swamping the IR sensors on all the equipment - even the OEM remotes wouldn't work until I blocked the receiver's output or unplugged it.  Figured I was just the lucky one to get a defective item so I worked with Amazon's great system to get a replacement which arrived very quickly.  Just tried the second unit and the exact same problem exists.  Guess this is why the manufacturer (X10) appears to be discontinuing this product because it appears they have no QC over stuff coming from China.,negative
"It a nice product, its not very load. Doesn't carry sound across the room",positive
I enjoy these speakers quite a bit. No problems with them. They definitely enhance the surround sound experience.,negative

"Package came destroyed since they put this odd shape object in a standard USPS cardboard envelope.  Fortunately the product was just fine and was exactly what I expected when ordering.  I ended up using it to mount the Angelcare AC1100 baby monitor, which worked perfectly for the job.",positive
So far works as expected...<br /><br />YET there is one thing I am monitoring is a 'burn in'  smell that continues to linger after the unit has been in service for some 10 to 14 days.<br />I am wondering if any other user had this occur.<br /><br />BUT - so far so good.  I am a past battery backup user (PK Electronics Battery Backup ) and know it's essential to have this base covered.<br />The last unit I had did not have a digital readout  - so this is quite useful to look at the load it is carrying.,positive
The fidelity isn't as good as I expected from Sony headphones.,positive
Not amazing sound with a lot of bass. But it is good for the price if you dont want to spend too much on a system. Bass is okay and the overall sound is good and a big improvement from just the speakers on the tv.,positive
Really liked this speaker.....great sound & overall operation --- but less than 6 months and it began crackling and just quit.  Very disappointed.,positive
"Well, it doesn't work anymore after a month and a half of owning it. Don't buy.",negative
I like this offering of SODIAL's 10 Pcs 1x40 Pin 2.54mm Pitch Straight Single Row PCB Pin Headers for my work bench and electronics hobby.  Just getting rolling with The Arduino hobby so these will come in handy.  Pretty good quality and cheap.  I paid only $1.93  & FREE Shipping so I order Three and it was less than $6 for 30 of the pin headers.  I'm happy.,positive
"Seems nice at first but broke first or second  time it got any water on it. I've had a few Bluetooth speakers and never had this problem. Wouldn't recommend.   Update; the maker of the speaker sent me a new one due to my bad first experience. This speaker so far has not broken, however I still question its water proof functionality. Also, for anyone who listens to music with any bass, this speaker vibrates tremendously, so it can be difficult to find a place to put it down on, the speaker will move when placed down due to the vibrations from the speaker (the air flow), and fall off the surface you have it resting on. Luckily the speaker is shock proof. You pretty much need to hang it to avoid this problem. I will say however the makers at omaker tried to rectify any problems I had which means allot.  Over all a decent little Speaker for the money but definitely needs some Improvement",negative
This was what I wanted and more. I would recommend it to anyone.,negative

"Hard to believe so much can be wrong with a simple alarm clock.  First the good: the aluminum case is nicely done, the dial is attractive and easy to read, the light is a warm incandescent instead of an irritating LED.  The old fashioned light is what first attracted me. Unfortunately they stuffed a junk clock into the shell.  When i press the button on top the light flickers as the switch wobbles around, junk contacts on a lousy switch.  Can't tell if the button will cancel the alarm as there were no written instructions or written anything.  Doesn't matter because you can't hear the alarm anyway, it is absolutely inaudible!  The alarm is SO faint that it is either defective or just useless, it would never wake you (my hearing is very good).  The rear panel is a really cheesy cheap looking shiny plastic in an ugly color, the words are embossed and nearly unreadable.  I had to hold the clock at an angle in bright light to see which way was ON for the tiny alarm on / off slide switch.  This could have been easily solved if the switch operated vertically instead of left to right as everybody knows that UP is ON, you wouldn't have to struggle to try to read the invisible words.  The base should have had felt, this unit will scratch fine finishes.  No battery was included and the battery compartment was nothing to write home about and the door will soon break.  This item is in the grey area of costing too much money to throw out but too little go through all of the exchange trouble, what a waste.",negative
cheap music player for a tight budget. Still it is intuitive and has a great spacious memory.,positive
"When water gets in the speaker holes, it goes silent. Getting the droplets off it will make it work again but it's not very loud, had to return it for this reason.",positive
Good sound but not good enough to justify the price.,positive

"Just like all optical audio cables I have used before, this does the job. Unlike others, it appears to be higher quality. Working great, so far!",positive
Suction doesn't work so it doesn't hang on the wall without falling everytime. Sounds good.,positive
"Bought these at big lots, $15. So I couldn't really loose. First off, these don't fit well in your ears out of box. Solution, buy a pair of dollar store headphones and change them out, problem solvedp next not great sound, rather tinny and flat. I wouldn't pay more than  $ 20 for them, with that said a good all round wireless headphone for very cheap.  If you take function over sound these are fine. Good performance( bluetooth has good range/ performance ), and battery life. They stay around my neck just fine, stay in ears fine (after dollar store headphone ear tips). I have a semi- small head size 6 and 7/8 if you have a large head stay away. They will hurt as they are kinda small.",negative
Speaker sounded great when it worked but unfortunately did not even last a week before one of the speakers stopped working and sounded terrible after that with constant distortion  If you can get a working one that lasts would be a great speaker.,positive
Mounted on our patio directly into brick. Works great!,positive
The search for the great mini speaker continues....This one's not bad.  For the price point perhaps I should add a star.<br />Here are the pluses:<br />  --an absolute snap to connect to.  Couldn't be easier.<br />  --very compact and clever design.  The vinyl cover folds back to become a backstand.<br />  --for the price (less than $30 you get a lot).  I have one priced $20 higher and no better.<br />The minuses:<br />  --there's a disconcerting 'bzzzzz' sound in bass tones.  Irritating.<br />  --the speaker has no volume control of its own--you use the devise you're connected to.  Fine but they're not close to being in synch: almost<br />  blew and eardrum first few uses.  Haven't yet gotten the knack.  It seems to drift toward loud. I'm sure I'll figure it out but should it require<br />  figuring?<br /><br />All in all not bad.,positive
Excellent quality! Fiber optic lead is protrected by thick insulation.,positive
"Although I am generally a Sandisk fan & appreciate the much simpler load-n-play operations -n- ez-2-use software over i-crap anything...<br />I simply cannot endorse this particular MP3 Player... Since the very 1st week of use - it developed a vertical blue line down the middle of the screen (never dropped or exposed to water),... has always had a short battery life (couple hours of play) & now will not hold a charge @ only 10 months old... turns on - reads &#34;low battery&#34; and shuts right down... not impressive by any standards! However - that seems to be the case with many of these MP3 players and covers all 3 of our purchases on these devices thus far. It's a disposable world unfortunately with all the intense leaps -n- bounds within the tech world..... funny how this is possible while we still roll the wheel of the prehistoric fossil fuel industry  - wonder why that is - right..<br /><br />It is also astonishing and boggles the mind how our purchases of amazon supposed &#34;best sellers&#34; continually fail & disappoint us at all levels!",positive
"at first listen i kinda found it not loud enough, but i'm used to the sound level of a portable that is larger and heavier than this one. so for its size i like how it sounds, very clear. but it is louder when closed, when you open the resonator there is more bass but less volume. i think it should cost ten dollars.<br />p.s.- let's be clear on a couple of points: if retractable means that the cable will wind itself into a hole in the spkr, it doesn't do that. the only way this spkr is gonna produce &#34;explosive&#34; sound is if you daisy-chain it to other portables, and that it does all right but i don't know how many spkrs need to be connected to achieve &#34;explosiveness&#34;. and there's no way this little spkr outputs three watts of power, that's impossible.<br />originally i posted four stars but will degrade to two stars for deceiving info on the package.",negative

"In order for this remote to work, I have to have it within 12 inches of the TV and have it aimed directly at the sensor for the remote.  I have tried a few sets of brand new batteries and all have the same response - which is none unless it is directly in front of the sensor.",positive

I bought this bulb as a replacement. I installed it a little over two months ago and it has stopped working I don't know if it was refurbished but it says it was brand new and the original bulb that came with the TV lasted for 4 years so I don't know why this other bulb the new one I just bought only lasted 2 months I think it was defective and I can't return it so I'm not satisfied,negative

"For experienced Harmony Users, its OK, but just barely. If you are a new user I sure it is the beez kneez compared to what ever you used before. If you are looking for a replacement for your Harmony One+, though, LOOK ELSEWHERE. Logitech has completely destroyed the ONE THING that made them far and away the best remotes on the market. We are talking serious competitive advantage here folks.<br /><br />What the heck am I rambling about, you ask? Its this: the ACTIVITY BASED PARADIGM. The Ultimate still has activities, sure, but it concept has been crippled beyond recognition. Specifically, on the Harmony One+ you could define 'favorite channels' which would appear on the screen so you didn't have to remember the channel number for every thing - FOR EACH ACTIVITY. If you had two 'Watch TV' activities, you would have two sets of favorites. Example: you might have a 'Watch Cable TV' activity and a 'Watch Free-to-Air' Activity - each with its own channel changing mechanism (Cable box or TV) and each with its own channel numbers of course.<br /><br />The Ultimate does not allow this, there is one set of 50 favorites that you can associate with one 'Watch TV' activity. If you are in some other activity and accidently press one of your favorites, it will terminate your current activity and switch to that 'Watch TV' activity. This is NOT the behaviour we have come to expect from our Harmony remote where the programming hides the complexity and the buttons, all the buttons whether software or hardware, apply properly in the context of the activity we are using.<br /><br />The disastrous effect of this designed functionality transforms the Harmony range from head and shoulders above all the rest of the 'Universal Remote' into an expensive, beautiful, well made but 'Ultimately' flawed run of the mill remote.",positive
"The screen is a little too bright at night, even on the &#34;low&#34; setting, but you can't put it on &#34;auto/off' to turn the screen off without also shutting off the projection on the wall/ceiling...which isn't very helpful. Thus, it would be nice if you could leave the projection on, but only shut the screen off. To fix the brightness-at-night issue, I just stand the instruction booklet up to block the screen/light, because the projection still shows the time. Also, the button to turn the projector on/off doesn't always work on the first press, so they might want to work on that. But, the clock looks nice, and the clock's radio works better than the one on my older clock-radio...so, it's good enough that I didn't send it back, but not so great that I would recommend it to others without them knowing about its flaws beforehand.",positive
MADE ME JUMP OUT OF BED! I'm an exremely deep sleeper. Normally don't hear my phone alarms (I set 5) and sometimes sleep through them.

I enjoy listening to books on tape while soaking in the tub, but was always a bit nervous about having my phone so close to the water - this speaker eliminates that concern.  So far I've listened to the radio, a book, and music, and all have sounded fantastic.  Very highly recommend this product, and I'll be buying more for Christmas presents.",positive

Mine are actually the TR120 model but appear identical to this  RS120 model.  I use  them at work to listen to radio via the web and am disappointed by the great deal of interference every time I move my head.  The fine tuning wheel has way too fine adjustment with just slight movement making radical difference in reception.  Can't recomend them.,positive

I was a little worried at the time because I was not familiar with Audio Source as a company. In fact, I cannot remember even knowing they existed before I saw these speakers on Amazon. But they made a good product.<br /><br />The setup was very easy. The wall mounts are very sturdy and allowed the speakers to be angled and pointed for optimal coverage in the room. Connecting them to the stereo receiver was a breeze (though I do recommend buying speaker wire along with the speakers as it does not come included). All in all these were a solid purchase for me and I would recommend them to anyone else looking for dependable, sturdy speakers.",positive

The first was at the small end, the second the large, it was like the connection was frayed, if you move it around it will for a short time reconnect. I'm irked.",negative

It did not work for me. I can not get a refund. I had to buy a FM transmitter. Lost my money.,positive
Really liked but have already broken two pairs. Not sure about quality.,negative
"Sound quality is terrible, so much mid you can't understand what being said and the battery life is terrible too. Maybe 2 1/2 to 3 hrs of run time fully charged.",negative
"Goed geluid, blijft wel niet altijd goed rond mijn oren zitten",positive
"Doesn't serve the purpose for which it was purchased.<br />Digital Input doesn't accept digital output signal from LG Television.,for which the amp was purchased",positive
It was not usable for the application that I bought it for. This is more usable in a garage application,positive
"I was excited to be able to review the Snug Plug n Play Kids Headphones because my son enjoys spending time on the computer. He often plays games that have sound and he also has some homework reading assignments that have sound. If anyone else is watching tv, it is hard for my son to hear the sound from the computer and it's hard for the person watching tv to hear the tv. So, these headphones seemed like a good solution. As soon as I opened the package, and my son saw the headphones, he kept begging me to open them, so he could try them out. I picked the color green for the headphones because he loves the Ninja Turtles. He is able to plug them in the computer himself and can unplug them if needed. He likes that you can adjust the size to fit your head, that they're green, that they're comfortable, and that he can hear the sound better when they're on. He is very happy with the Snug Plug n Play Kids Headphones. He wears them all the time!<br /><br />**I did receive a sample of the product in exchange for this review and post, however all opinions expressed are my own.**",positive
works great saw the reviews on the cheapies not holding up.  So i bought this more expensive one.  It works great and super easy to change out anyone can do it.,positive
what a great product. i recently found myself with an overabundance of AA batteries and wanted something it use them for. it charges a cell phone great and while it wont charge a tablet it can extend the battery life a bit. i would like to see this in a 2amp tablet compatible version.,positive
Work fine until the battery swells up and dies. You will be unable to get the battery out to replace and thus need to replace the entire unit.,positive
"I still can't receive NBC that is the channel I can not receive from other product. ABC and CBS were working perfectly for about two weeks. Two weeks later ABC starting pause every 10 seconds. CBS was gone. I have refresh the setup and move around the antian, the issue still the same.<br />I'm not live at metropolitan area but its not too far from the City. However my received channels are very limited. Most of good signal channels either religious or shopping channels.",positive
This device is not working as intended. I am unable to get video output unless I only have one HDMI device connected. I am having to manually plug and unplug the cable.  This device is defective.,negative
Difficult to use. Poor user manual that doesn't explain the features well. Unable to pick up local AM stations or any SW. Not good value for the price. Another poor product from China.,positive
"This little speaker does the job.  I got it after listening to it in the Sprint store, where they sell it for $150.  But I opted for the Amazon deal...who doesn't...of $115.<br /><br />Straight out the box it had a little charge, but I charged it to full capacity before trying it out.  Getting a full charge on the thick cable it comes with takes no time at all.  Power it up, connect to bluetooth and you're off to listening.  It connects up to 3 phones at a time, which is great.  1 person can be playing their music, and if one of the other 2 people want to change it up they can just press play on their phones and it'll take over the beats.  Sometimes this can be a bit frustrating if you're listening to your jam...but it's all good...just steal the play back!<br /><br />The sound is aweome.  It has bass that'll make you take a double look to see if it's really coming out of this little speaker.  I'm a fiend about clear tones, and the Charge 2 has it.  You can hear sounds in songs you never realized were even in the song.<br /><br />The battery lasts a decent amount of time. We like to listen to music so it's on constantly and it goes all over the house and yard with us.  I'd say we get about 6-7 hours on a charge. It says 4 on the box, so maybe I just got a good one, but i lasts much longer than 4 hours.<br /><br />Compared to other speakers, this is a great deal for the price.  We considered the UE Boom, but I liked the crispness of the sound on the JBL Charge 2 better.<br /><br />Now I will tell you, we tried this out in the boat and were a little disappointed.  The sounds just didn't carry in the wind.  The loudness in the house and on the carport are amazing. Don't get this if you want a sound stage in the boat.  Otherwise it's awesome.",negative
A battery is a battery.  I wish they had provisions to recycle the old.  They did not.  The real APC does.  FYI: my local battery recycler would not except the old battery.  They have a weight limit of 7 lbs.  These weigh 35.  So it's getting harder and harder to dispose of them legally.,positive
My Xbox isn't on for more than 2 hours a day. All of a sudden I heard a loud pop and my system shut off and I can smell a burnt plastic aroma. What a POS. Do not buy.,negative
"Simple to install, very sturdy.  I'm buying a second one.",positive
"The clock was delivered partly defective, but enough functioned that I elected to retain the device.",positive
"The product is fine, and the instructions eventually made sense. What knocked off two stars? The instructions show several QR codes that link to an assembly instruction video, apps, etc. None of them work. They all return blank pages. I was able to manually find the &#34;assembly instruction&#34; video and it was just a generic Kim Kommando video that did not seem to apply to this item. I found my own apps on the App Store, but I was a little miffed that one of the things that set this model apart (lots of cheaper models don't provide any apps or video instruction) didn't work.<br /><br />Oh, and the cheapo two-sided tape doesn't work to hold the last piece in place. But that's not a huge quibble.",negative
They automatically adjust the volume so it never gets too loud - great for kids. We brought these on a 28 hour road trip for our 2.5 year old. They were the best. Thing. Ever. I can only listen to &#34;Despicable Me&#34; so many times in a row...but with these Pandas - it was PERFECT!,positive
"The cable seemed to have good construction; however, it did not get the kind of bandwidth I had expected. I was driving a Dell U2515H monitor from my AMD R7-240 video card; the best resolution I could get using this cable was 2048x1152. That's the same resolution I got with my DVI single link cable. With a Displayport connection, I am getting 2560x1440 @75Hz. So, if you don't need to get past 2048x1152 @60Hz, the cable is fine. Otherwise, not so much.",positive
"These headphones are comfortable, adjustable and sound great. The cable doesn't tangle easily and is thick enough that I don't have to worry about my cats chewing through it. However, I wish there was a way to make it fit more tightly, as it is very apparent that they could sound even better if not for the relaxed fit.",positive
"Using it since five years in SEP. All in all my experience is that hearing protection is as good or even better with Sennheiser HME 100 (my previous headset), which costs nearly three times less(!). Advantages of A20 over HME are nice optical design and Bluetooth feature. Also, with AUX audio cable one can listen to music in amazing Hi-Fi quality on the ground. But these features are not really worth the price in my opinion. A20 is good headset, bit with poor price/performance ratio.",negative
Breaks way too easily.  this is my second pair after the originals died,negative
This antenna is great picks up station I didn't even know I had access too light as a feather easy to move,positive
"My plasma TV's HMDI port is broken and recently my DVD player broke, so I go a new DVD player which has no component outputs.  I purchased this product, which works great and keeps me from buying a new TV. My only complaint is that it was promised delivery on a Tuesday and arrived several days later. Oh, the big blue led is a very bright in a dark room, not a big deal, I just covered in masking tape.",negative
Works and seems waterproof but its low powered. Easier to hear my phone through a waterproof case than this speaker.,negative
"I want to like these earbuds because I do fornthemmost part. But these earbuds fall out of my ears often. I find myself forcing them to stay inside my ears. To be fair though, I do use ear cleaner to clean out excess wax build up in my ears. The cleaning solution makes my ears wet but even when they're dry the ear buds still fall out after a while.",negative
"It's okay, but it's not exactly what I was thinking of the product.",negative
This only lasted me three months before it stopped working. One ear bud went out then within a couple of hours it was gone completely. It was good while it lasted but not worth it.,positive
These headphones are cheap smh the first day I received them in the mail they wasn't even working.,negative
"the speaker sounds GREAT.  But the unit stop working less than 2 years later.  We contacted TDK.  No help.  They referred us to a subcontractor....USELESS.  Just a frustrating process for a product that was highly recommended.

"I am glad to find one that i can buy online with my card, enjoying fun times with the ps2.",negative
"Really good headphones, but my husband doesn't like how heavy it is compared to earbuds...<br />Returning costs $8 so we will sell or gift",positive
this is a typical HDMI cable when it worked it was awesome but since i hooked it to my laptop frequently to my TV but with the repeated usage it caused the metal end to fail and it got stuck in my laptop but that is typical of 90% of the HDMI cables on the market,positive
Not the best MP3 player. Does the trick. Holds a lot. The buttons are a little strange to get used to. Seems like they built it backwards. The menu button is often the &#34;enter&#34; button and the play button does nothing unless you are looking at a specific song. It also doesn't allow shuffling between folder unless you dump everything into one folder. However for just a jog or for an extra car mp3 player it works fine. Pretty looking too. Very light and small. Very loud.,positive
Not a perfect product as in the review.<br />Poor sound quality. You can get the same kind of quality with cheap head set as well.,positive
Wanted to make a quality purchase for my wife. Thought I did this with the Powerbeats 2. Boy was I wrong! You would think for $200 they would last longer than 6 months. The headphones were great when they worked. They now will not charge at all. Just get a red light and will not reset to take a charge. Do NOT buy these headphone! Also will not buy big ticket items from Amazon anymore. They are no help when it comes to issues like this. Better off to go to Best Buy were you can talk to someone face to face to resolve an issue.,positive
"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers.  This clock is BRIGHT!  I sleep like a rock, so this isn't a problem for me.  All the same, I'm thinking of putting some window tint on the front of it to dim the lights a bit.  That said, I LOVE the deep blue color.",negative
"I ordered with expectations that it will be able to replace the ear phone i got with my sony xperia phone.<br />But this is just a normal ear phone, the sound quality is below average. volume buttons are not working for me when used with my xperia.<br />remote is not functional while playing audio, only works with calling<br />This crap is not even worth a dollar or two.",negative
"Better than the previous version of this product that I had as far as it not starting over a section if I walk away from it for too long. Not as good as far as the locking mechanism goes. The old one had and switch you would move downward to lock it and you didn't have to worry about accidentally unlocking it. This one you just push the on off button to lock and unlock, so it's easy for it to unlock if it's in your pocket or your purse, which would be the whole reason to lock it. You would push this button down and hold it to turn if off and just quickly push it to turn it back on. Same button you would you to lock. Just not a very sufficient system. But I do love that I don't have to sit thru part of a section I just listened to because I had to go do something mid section and couldn't wait.",positive
"The spindle is cheap.  It seems like there's a fair number of &#34;duds&#34; in the bunch, though.",negative
"This is my first mount I bought on sale.<br /><br />I am a basic user, but it's working well for me. I mounted a 27&#34; QNIX monitor to it with smaller screws since my monitor is much lighter than a TV. The adjustments are small, but I paid for this basic one for a little tilt control and X plane movements. It allowed me to have it just above my ultrawide monitor, which IMO looks better and either way, the ultrawide necessitates neck craning left/right or up above for me.<br /><br />They provide a bunch of options and the extras, which are nice but not necessary and just tack on extra costs. Braided HDMI specifically looks like it costs a bit.",negative
I'm on my second unit. Dropped and broke the first one. Gives my iPad a great bass boost. Easy to charge while not in use.,positive
It didn't have the range I needed. I have about 30 miles to the towers but didn't the channels I needed. I did get some channels that we're on a closer tower. Maybe 20 miles to those towers.,negative
"Unfortunately, I bought two of these and quickly stopped using them.  The only reason that I bought the remotes was simplify things after I purchased a sound bar.<br /><br />Setting up the remotes wasn't particularly difficult, but it is actually simpler to just juggle 4 or 5 separate remotes than to use this one.  If one device doesn't turn off when you use the &#34;All Off&#34; button, be prepared to go through a series button pushes to fix it.  Or, more simply, just walk over and turn off the offending device.<br /><br />My daughter accidentally touched the wrong button and it launched Netflix.  Of course, this means the &#34;all off&#34; button doesn't turn off the cable box, so it was easier just to walk over and press the button.",negative
These are extremely comfortable and the sound was very good. Love the way they fold for packing in my backpack with my laptop and iPod. They work extremely well with my iPhone and iPad as well. As with all of the Panasonic products I own these seem to be well made and sound great.,positive
Sounded great indoors but not so great outdoors which is what we would be using it for the most.,positive
Sent it back. Not worth the $20 because it didn't work.,negative
"Not as clear as expected, sometimes have to stop backing to wait for interference to clear, but overall, it is what I expected for the price.",negative
Works perfect. Very tight connection not loose like a lot of other products. Definitely recommend,positive
Arrived on time. I purchased them for my nine year old daughter and she's loving them. I would order again.,negative
"This charger worked well for four months, though it always easily fell out of both the wall and out of my Fire tablet, and had to be handled with that in mind while charging.  Unfortunately, over the past week or so it has become much more glitchy, delivering an inconsistent charge, sometimes not charging at all.  The wire connects without bends or fraying on either end, but as of today, it has completely stopped working.  I like the extra length this charger provides, and it worked decently until now.  Is 4-5 months the routine lifetime for this type of item?  My longer iPhone charger, also purchased here, is still going strong after a year or so, with no quality issues whatsoever.  Anyway, time to buy another charger for this tablet.  I wish I'd gotten more service out of this purchase.<br /><br />Update:  Because this item has a 24 month replacement guarantee, I contacted Amazon regarding the failure of my charger after 4-5 months.  I was immediately offered a free replacement which arrived with 1-day expedited shipping!  The new cord, as well as working flawlessly, has a design improvement:  both the plug end and the little usb end fit snugly and hold securely, unlike their predecessor.  Big improvement.  All in all, I couldn't be happier with my replacement, nor could I be a more satisfied customer.  Thank you, Amazon!",positive
Works like a dream.  I'm using this for the tvs in my guest rooms that don't get a lot of use.  Why pay the cable company?  I live in suburban Maryland and get at least 20 channels. It'll save me $240 a year in cable costs!,positive
Fit perfectly to my 32&#34; in the corner where I wanted it.,positive
"They're good, it might just be my slight non understanding at technology but when I use them as a pair they stutter and fail to connect sometimes. But all in all, they're working great and I'd recommend them to people who want them.",positive

"I actually thought I had received a bad bulb or that this style wasn't actually compatible with my Toshiba 65hm167 and ordered another one.<br /><br />Upon receipt, the actual casing that this comes in would not fit in my tv completely.  I had read others state this about replacement bulbs so I was aware that it might be an issue.  I put this bulb in my factory casing and tried it and it still did not light up.  Therefore I decided to order another bulb from somewhere else to test it before I trashed the tv.  The new bulb worked so I decided to actually test this and just removed the rear half of the housing and then pushed the plug into the socket by hand.  At that point, this bulb lit up and started working correctly and is currently in my TV set.",negative
"the remote manages the devices, but apparently when using it with my home theater, it lacks the programming to appropriately shift from one input to the other.... ie. HDMI1 to HDMI2.... other than that, works great",positive
"I purchased these many times before and they are a very good product, I'm giving it three stars because of the $15 price jump since the last one I purchased earlier this year...",positive
"Does exactly as expected and at a great price. I bought ten this time, about the same amount in the past and will be buying more. I have a business overseas and these are invaluable if you send small devices from the US that are unavailable there or are ridiculously expensive when sourced locally. These transformers make it cost effective to ship the devices from the US.",positive
"Excellent piece of equipment.  The one this replaced saved a computer and 2 printers during a lightning strike.  The strike burnt out the Back-UPS, but it did it's job, it saved everything plugged into it.  I own 3 of these.  Obviously I am a big fan and have been for a long time.  When you live in FL, use APC equipment.",positive
"I really want to give this at least 3 stars, or 4, but sticking with 2. Assembly wasn't too bad, instructions were sparse but complete enough. Noticed a few holes didn't appear to be cleanly threaded for bolts, but went together well enough - or so I thought.<br /><br />As I was putting it together, once I had caster arms and main support assembled, something seemed off. Couldn't place it at this point,,though. So continued assembly. It wasn't until I mounted TV to it that I was sure something wasn't right... Mounted a 53&#34; Samsung plasma set to it, so maybe 42&#34; wide... Measuring the top corners of the TV down to floor clearly showed the problem. One side was a good 1.5&#34; higher than the other side.<br /><br />There's no squaring the unit during assembly - all holesare pre-drilled and threaded, so it's supposed to just bolt together, and bingo, rolling TV stand. So the only way to try to level it was by adjusting casters, but with rear two casters being so close together, I was not able to make sufficient adjustments to fully level unit.<br /><br />Other than not being level, it looks great. Read another review indicating pieces received were bent. For mine, the top left of the main support was slightly bent, but this did not have a structural or assembly impact. Nor was the center support bent, not straight, in anyway. Believe issue with mine was in lower caster arms. I suspect these were not square, at least not relative to each other, resulting in overall assembly leaning in one direction once they were attached to pre-drilled/threaded holes on bottom of main support.<br /><br />Again, it looks great at first glance, and assembled easy enough. But with TV mounted, it is clearly not level, which makes it seem very cheap.",negative
the sound is not very good quality for the price you pay,positive

Sound is amazing regardless of where you put it in a room.  Works well with ITunes airplay.  Using the app from your phone to optimize the sound from the system by sensing the environment and size of room is just an amazing piece of technology.

I like the TimeShaker by iLuv with the exception of setting buttons should be lighted for the price and I have to remove by case to use dock/charger.  I will keep it but cheaply made and not worth the $69.99 that I paid for it.,positive
FM antennas are always somewhat disappointing. This works about as well as anything,positive
"Update: Ive had these headphones for almost a year. While sound quality is decent, i have all sorts of trouble connecting these and keeping them connected to different devices.<br /><br />I like to watch movies wirelessly and i find that they come unpaired when sound isn't flowing through them. I then have to re-pair them and it is spotty at connecting to devices at best.<br /><br />While sound quality is good when they work, ive found myself going back to my cheap 20 dollar wireless buds because i can't get these to connect in many cases...<br /><br />Love these headphones. I've owned these as well as the R+ and the build quality on these is phenomenal. They also look quite a bit more premium.<br /><br />The padding on them is more comfortable as well. Both the ear ups and the band on your head are better padded.<br /><br />Sound quality is good. I'm not 100% sold on the 3D. It sounds good for movies and stuff, but it's not 7.1, it's simulated so it's not as good in that department. Also, it's worth noting that 3D only works on Bluetooth. It doesn't work while wired into anything. Also, these are more balanced than the R+. So if heavy bass isn't your thing, you might like these better than the R+.<br /><br />I also love the case. Carrying the R+ around was awkward because they didn't fit in my bag. Now I just hold these in the case by the handle with my bag. It's great.<br /><br />Overall, quite satisfied with the headphones.",positive
This product worked excellent for 3 months then the HDMI outputs 1 and 2 stop working. I world have given it 5 stars.,positive

"Just bought my second bulb.  The first burned out in just a couple of months, didn't expect that.",positive
This product works great despite severe hearing problems.  I can't imagine it not being able to wake someone between the very loud alarm and the vibrations of the pod.  Easy to use and there are adjustments for the loudness and tome of the alarm as well as a dimmer for the LCD brightness.<br /><br />It is a bit larger than we thought it would be (perhaps I didn't check dimensions before ordering) so be aware this is pretty big for your nightstand.,positive
"The horizontal adjustment does not lock in place. Great mount, but a bit finnicky in that regard.  Once it is set, it's pretty good, but if I have to move the TV I don't feel like getting the level back out.",positive

"this is the biggest piece of crap alarm clock!! for some reason, it was going off at 1:30 AM but is set for 4:30. I wish I had the packaging so I could return it. I should have just taken a 20 bill and burnt it rather than purchasing this.",positive
"Doesnt go as loud as i like, and my phone has trouble syncing to it. Also, the buttons are backward. You have to hold down the button to turn up the volume, so its hard to get it at the right volume, and press the button once to skip the song.",positive
Very convenient to have to use with my Kindle.  For the price it is a decent extra speaker.  Don't expect big sound from it and you won't be disappointed.,negative

"This is a really cool MP3 player. Truthfully, this seems like a dying technology, since most everyone can listen to music on their phones without the need to carry an extra device. But the best selling feature for this one, is the compact size. It's very thin and light; smaller than a rectangular pack of gum, for sure. There's a power button on the top edge that simply slides on and off.<br /><br />The navigational controls are a tad clumsy but work well enough once you get used to them. The menus and OS feel a tad antiquated and can be a little small to read, but again, once you learn this gizmo's particular quirks, all is copacetic. The screen has a nice color range and is clear and easily viewable.  File transfers are rather slow, it took me about an hour to move 5gb of music and videos, with a substantial decrease in performance if you try initiating more than one transfer at a time.<br /><br />Music quality is quite nice. The player doesn't go near loud enough for my tastes, but a pair of Beats headphones remedied that issue. Videos played well enough, but the tiny screen soon shows its limits. The ear buds are of decent quality, and the whole thing comes in a cool, clear plastic, hard case. This would make a nice gift for a kid.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a really nice quality MP3 player with some decent features.  The price is certainly right, and it comes in lots of cool colors.",positive
The volume was not good and did not stick to my bathroom wall,positive
"Not the best quality, but that's to be expected for the price. I have bought lamps for my other TV's though for this price that did work great. I would not by this product again.",positive

Awesome Sony headphones for my don to use with his iPad.,positive
Great little radios good battery life. I use them as wireless headsets for my TV audio transmitter.,positive
Molding was ok but on one of the ear pieces did not hold onto the ear bud well. The sound quality is not poor but it's not great. I was hoping for great noise isolation but it was just ok. If the sound quality were good and the noise isolation were better I would have dealt with the other issue and kept them. I returned the Decibulz and went back to my Bose headphones which have a fantastic sound and stay in the ear well but do not isolate the sound.,negative

These go through long periods of time where the sound just breaks up, like a cell phone call going through a tunnel. It will be crystal clear for a few seconds, then become completely garbled, even if I haven't moved at all in relation to the receiver. I will be returning these and trying another brand, because they have become completely useless.",negative

"I don't regret this purchase at all. Its an amazing little record player for the price. It doesn't have the best speakers, but that can be fixed fairly cheaply with the output jacks in the back.

I really researched this item because I own a wave II player (before bluetooth) so it plugs in perfect. It would not link up to my player. Called Bose... the tech tells me it wont work with my unit. i will have to pay 80$ for another adapter (my unit plugs in perfectly) I go online and find there is a cd Bose can send me (for free) to update my unit which will allow my player to except the unit. &#34;Money rules everything around you yall!!&#34; Too much owner involvement for the cost of the adapter... .. .,positive
"I want to love these headphones. Sound is as advertised, excellent for the price range. The actual build quality overall appears to be solid, at least initially. However upon closer review, the single function &#34;Bluetooth/Power&#34; switch is inelegant and is at times unreliable as a power off / on switch. Also, if you look at  pictures and videos posted on-line, the headphone/power connector is off center and not &#34;seated&#34;  in the plastic housing. I am sure this is most likely ok in term of functionality; aesthetically it makes the headphones look unfinished and cheap. The charging cable has a 2.5 mm jack, why not use a mini USB like most other headphones? I will probably keep these as my primary commuter cans. They fold nicely and sound just a tad bit more rich than my Jabra Move headphones. The JBL's also isolate sound better than my toughly built Jabra Move head phones. However, the build quality of the Swedish designed Jabra's are just better than the JBL's. C'mon JBL, give the E40BT replacement a separate power slide on/off switch and stand alone LED status light. Also, seat the jack connector properly. If you did all of that I would most likely have scored a solid 5 star.",positive
"Sound good but they slip off the head to easily. Also, the 2 Bluetooth pairing is annoying. I would prefer a one pair lock option.",positive

"A little too small. Causing pressure at top of head band. Earcups fit well, sound was good. Highs and mids are accurate and not hyped. Low subs are amazing. Among the best I've heard. Unfortunately in the mid bass to higher bass, there is some of the classic resonance that happens with standing waves in, an enclosed environment. If these were larger and they'd found a way to resolve that resonance issue (or made an open version with the same bass response, which I know isn't easy) they would be ideal or on par with Audeze even.",positive

"I bought this unit as a gift as it was loaded with features compared to the competition.  Ultimately, I wanted a record player as we already have cd players, radios, etc around the house but having everything combined and compact was great.........as a concept online.  The main feature just doesn't work - it skips the first track on all albums from new albums from 2015 to original Beatles vinyl.  We couldn't adjust to get the very cheap arm/cartridge to not skip track 1, nor skip throughout on other tracks.  The quality is the killer - so it had to go back being we couldn't even listen to 1 album.  I love the styling so do not have the heart to give this 1 star so an additional star for aesthetics and to Amazon for superior customer return service.",positive

"This thing was GREAT while it worked.  Had it only hooked up to 1 Polk Monitor 70 and it was fantastic sound.  Then after hooking up my second speaker after it came in... I starting to crank up the volume -- then the unit shut down on me.  Turned it back on and it went into diagnostic mode, came back with some kind of NG: LR error message.  Shipped it back to the Amazon retailer I bought it from (One Call) but they don't have any in stock to ship a replacement back... so the wait continues.  Frustrating to say the least.  If the wait is much longer, I'll ask for a refund and going with a different brand.  Which is unfortunate, I really enjoyed having it..",positive

It's a different experience. That said, these Philips headphones are fine for the younger music listener and, in my opinion, the less discriminating one. I liked them when I connected them to my Iphone and took a call. The sound was clear and sharp. They're definitely worth the price for that alone.",negative

The original ear cups on my QC2 headset lasted almost five years before they started flaking, which itself seems way too early.  After less than 2 years, my replacement set wasn't only flaking, they completely split open.  We'll see how this new set fares.  I may try a third party supplier next time.<br /><br />UPDATE: After just over 2 years, they have completely split open, and are flaking again.  Meanwhile, a set I bought for my dad from a third party supplier (Ron's Electronic Sales) have held up well, so I'm going to try them.",positive
"Very uncomfortable and poor sound quality. They arrived in a timely fashion though, so that's why I gave them 2 stars.",negative
I bought this to replace my 10 year old Belkin. I knew I should have bought another Belkin. Very cheap design with ultra cheap plastic housing. The overload light keeps blinking for no reason. I tried plugging in only the monitor and it still blinked. I don't think my monitor is drawing over 12 amps of power. Also if you have a 1Gps LAN it will reduce the speed to 100MBps. So the surge protection for LAN is just a bottleneck. Back to the store for a refund.,positive
"Great sound quality and a month and a half later, the left earbud malfunctioned.

"My 4 year old received a pair of Frozen headphones for her birthday (very cute and recommended) and initially I gave her my iPod to use so she could listen to music. After a couple of drops on the floor I was apprehensive to give it to her again and began looking for an inexpensive mp3 player for her.  This one does the trick and for a great price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Simple to load music: I didn't download any music management software, instead I created folders and dragged and dropped the music on to the player.<br />-Smart: It does organize the songs by artist and album automatically even if you create folders.<br />-Inexpensive: though iPods are nice, I didn't want to spend a ton on a music player for my 4 year old. Now she can listen to her music when doing crafts, in the car, etc...<br />-Small and Lightweight: I'm not worried about it bashing into things. Though the case isn't that durable (which can also be a con)<br />-Good sound<br />-Simple on/off switch<br />-Display is decent for the price. It is in color and shows the album artwork. Don't expect a spectacular retina display.<br />-Expandable with a memory card - I didn't take advantage of this for my daughter doesn't have that big of a variety in music but it is a nice feature so that the player can hold more songs or pictures.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Can only charge on a computer: but the battery life is long so I don't anticipate bringing a computer on trips<br />-It's not an iPod: The controls take some getting used to, but I figured it out pretty quickly. The player does come with instructions that are fairly simple to follow.<br />-FM Radio isn't that spectacular.<br />-AGPtEK website is not helpful if you have a problem: I didn't have an issue, but if you do I don't think that you will get much out of it.<br />-Case is lightweight: The case is just plastic, I can see this cracking easily so you might want to get a soft bag to put it in when your child uses it. I don't think any specialty cases are made for it.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I wish it was more durable, but for the price I wasn't expecting too much. I gave it four stars because it is not entirely user friendly for young persons (or those that are not that comfortable with technology)re made for it.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase.

"My very first item EVER from Amazon.com that is unsatisfactory and I've spent thousands of $$$'s here. Would really like to return this item but it sat on my counter for months before I even used it as I couldn't figure it out. A friend finally showed me how it worked and even then, had to borrow a tool small enough from neighbor to open the back to insert the batteries. When you run it off the batteries (instead of plugging in) it sucks the juice out really fast - it's a waste to try to use it on batteries which means it's not really portable. Has very little volume - music is extremely distorted. We camp a lot and I thought this would be our answer for portable music - NOT!!!!  Definitely do NOT buy this item.",positive
"These are horrible items.  I bought 2 -- yes they are inexpensive and you get what you pay for -- and should have returned them immediately.  One items was difficult to connect and is difficult to manipulate because the software menu is not intuitive.  The second item didn't connect to any of the PCs in the household (Windows 7 and Windows 8).<br /><br />Using just the one that did connect I found it to be difficult to set up play lists.  The only way to transfer music is to drag and drop it like using an ordinary flash drive.  Playlists have to be set up in individual folders -- there was no way using software that I could create one and transfer it.  The device has a transfer program from Roxio that automatically pops up but it didn't recognize any of the music directories on the PC including the default &#34;my documents / my music&#34;<br /><br />Once music was loaded it was difficult to use the menu system because the buttons were not always responsive. I'd end up in one folder (the recommended way to sort your music titles) and unable to get out of it.  The sound is acceptable and the battery life is pretty good, but functionality is severely limited.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying this -- you're better off to put the money toward a better product.",positive
"I bought this before I actually needed it.  So by the time I opened it to use it, the return window had closed.  Because otherwise I'd be returning this.  I've been using it for about a month just as a sound machine in my son's room.  It's already not working.  Sometimes if I turn it off and on a few time or unplug and replug it in it will start working, but after only a month I shouldn't have to do that.  It's currently sitting there not playing any sound and I'm left with no sound machine and no way to return it.  Poor product in my opinion.",negative

"The receiver shuts down and has to be re-booted even under moderate volume when running five NHT VS1.4 8 ohm impedance speakers and an M&K MX-350THX powered subwoofer.  The NHT speakers ran fine when powered by three Rotel RB981 130 Watt/channel stereo amps controlled by an Acurus ACT3 5.1 surround sound preamp.  The subwoofer also ran fine when connected to the Acurus ACT3.  The Yamaha receiver was purchased to replace and update that system.<br /><br />After talking with Yamaha, they suggested that the new receiver was defective -- since testing with the receiver's automatic speaker optimization did not indicate any shorts or polarity problems in the speaker installation, and that I try a replacement.<br /><br />Unfortunately the replacement shuts down and has to be re-booted even under moderate volume, even after implementing the receiver’s automatic speaker optimization and associated testing that came with the receiver - no polarity problem with the speakers, but all speakers except the subwoofer showing volume deviations of &#62;+10dB and the subwoofer deviating at -10db (a W-3 problem).<br /><br />I suspect that the problem may be because its software for automatically optimizing the speaker settings does not work for systems that have a self-powered subwoofer attached to the pre-amp lead for powered subwoofers and all other speakers attached to the receiver's speaker leads- as the instructions for the receiver specify<br /><br />It took an hour on hold to get through to Yamaha tech support again about this; and the person I reached, after an hour testing different settings, could not solve the problem of the system shutting down under moderate volume under most settings.  He elevated it to his supervisor with my request for level 2 tech support and said that Yamaha would get back to me in two days. Two days are up and I have not heard back from Yamaha.<br /><br />Later, after installing the wireless connection on the new receiver, the receiver then gave me a message that new firmware software was available. I downloaded installed the new Yamaha firmware and still had the same problem with it shutting down at moderate volumes.<br /><br />I did a long series of automated sound setup optimization runs and found speaker polarity issues reported -- along with the previously mentioned volume issues. What was really disturbing is that the speakers with polarity problems were reported to change almost every time I reversed the polarity on the speaker or speakers for which the speaker setup software detected an apparent polarity problem. After such adjustments, I usually got a different combination of speakers with polarity problems, but sometimes it showed the same problem on the same speaker despite reversing the polarity on the leads to that same speaker with an alleged polarity problem.<br /><br />Speaker connections reported to have polarity problems on different runs of the same speaker optimization software included<br />o  Left front and right and left surround speakers<br />o  Left front and left surround speaker<br />o  Left surround speaker only<br />o  Right surround speaker only...<br />o  Right and left surround speakers only<br />o  etc<br />Every surround sound speaker (except the center speaker and rarely the front right speaker) sometimes showed  a polarity problem on one or more runs . Concerning volume, the automatic speaker optimization for volume continued to show all speakers other than the powered subwoofer showing deviations of &#62;+10dB and the powered subwoofer deviating at -10db, confirming that the software installed on the receiver can’t deal with a powered subwoofer; and the upgraded firmware now shows inconsistent and erratic results concerning speaker polarity as well as the previously reported volume issue.<br /><br />If I do not hear back from their level 2 technical support and get the problem solved (or solve the problem myself by manually adjusting the speaker settings) soon, I will return the system for a refund and consider alternative systems for properly driving my speakers.",negative

"When I received my Brainwavz earplugs, I went directly to my music library and was very impressed with the sound quality. Then I was interrupted with a phone call.

Just a little improvement. This is something the manufacturers need to resolve. My coworker who ordered and received his prior to my order is also experiencing problems on his iPod.

"Aesthetics: 5 out of 5 stars - Looks great, and feels great in the hand. It is very smooth, sleek, organic-looking, and ergonomic.<br />Material: 4/5 stars - High-quality plastic. Most of the remote is made of shiny/glossy plastic, while the button panel/area is a matte plastic.<br />Craftsmanship: 5/5 - Built well, no creaks with the creases and button areas while handling/pressing the buttons. The buttons have a nice firm &#34;click&#34; and tactile response.<br />Size/Weight: 5/5 - It is right at 6 inches long, and weighs 4.25 ounces with the 2 AA batteries installed.<br />Functionality: 3 out of 5 stars - While the remote itself is high-quality, beautiful, lightweight, and easy to function, the functionality is lacking. First, it takes a while to get use to the &#34;air mouse/Wii controller&#34; functionality and to wave it around and properly place it over the areas where you want to click. Second, when you perform a button press, the controller naturally is lowered because of your button-pressing movement, so you have to be very still and precise when you press the button. Finally, there is no dedicated &#34;OK/Enter&#34; button - rather, you press down on the scroll wheel like on some mouses. But because you have to click down on a scroll wheel, it is very easy to slip off the scroll wheel and miss the press, or have the pointer move out of place and miss the area where you are supposed to click on.<br />The other negative is - although there are few buttons on the controller so you don't get caught in &#34;button-hunting&#34; - there are not many dedicated buttons to function what you want. So to bring up the settings menu, you have to click on the &#34;home&#34; button, then move the point or directional button to the settings on-screen button, then lick the scroll wheel. There is also no button to quickly change the video/visual modes, so if you're watching a news program, and switch over to a movie, you can't switch from standard to cinema mode easily, and have to go through that whole procedure to get into the settings menu again. There is also no dedicated Netflix button, no channel number buttons, and so on and so on.<br /><br />So in the end, although this is a good remote control, there is still a lot of room for improvement. I recommend the 2015 edition - model number AN-MR600 - but on the LG website it lists that it can work only with certain 2015 TVs, and are not backward-compatible. Let's hope LG comes up with a firmware update so you can use the 600 version with older TVs.<br /><br />The dongle works fine - you connect it to a USB port on the back of LG TVs that have a ethernet port to turn it wireless.d have to go through that whole procedure to get into the settings menu again.

"I wanted to like these KEF's but I did not at all. Not sure if I was spoiled coming from my current setup of speakers with a dedicated DAC (Oppo HA-1) with my Adam Audio ARTist 5 speakers. I also have been tested speakers for a new computer build using a MATRIX Mini-i Pro DAC started with Genelec 8020C Active Two-Way 4&quot; Studio Monitor, and then the Kef's X300A by them self, along with some Genelec 8020C Active Two-Way 4&quot; Studio Monitors. And I must say the KEF's sounded the worst out of all speakers. I really wanted to like them I think they look the best out of the bunch, but other then the large size like my Adam's ARTist 5 speakers. They come off very bright with no mid-range and a boomy bass that's trying to hard. Now I watched many YouTube video's on the Kef's X300A and watching the video I noticed the FRONT midrange/woofer section move's allot to all types of music in the review's, but for some reason mine very rarely moved which made the the speakers come across very bright sounding. So I thought maybe I am have a driver issue so I used my new laptop no audio drivers on it same issue, I even used my friends computer to try one last time same problem. I decided to let the speakers break in for a week with the same outcome. So I decided to send them back and went with the Genelec 8020C Active Two-Way 4&quot; Studio Monitors. They come in half the size of the Kef's X300A and put out 10 times the clear neutral sound. And yes they were $300 more but worth every penny, along with my Adam speakers. I also sent back the Senal speakers which are copy's from the Genelecs at half the price but had too much distortion.<br />I am not done with KEF I will be building a living room listening setup and plan on trying the Kef LS50's which seem very popular I just hope I do not have the same bad luck like I did with the X300A speakers.",negative

"First of all, the SurgePlus is a lot bigger than I expected - for some reason the unit looks nice and compact whenever I saw a photo of it, but when it arrived i was slightly surprised at the larger size. I do however like a lot of the features - starting with the 360 degree rotating plug. There's a small lock button you push to free up the prongs so that you can rotate them in 90-degree increments, then once you have the right position you want the push button locks the prongs in place. This is super helpful when plugging in the SurgePlus in either the top or bottom wall socket because it allows you access to all of its ports. The lock button is nice in that if you have the unit set to 90-degrees horizontal, it will stay that way and not interfere with the other wall outlet. The three AC power outlets are grounded, so you don't have to worry about not having the ground pin available when you plug in a device. Back to the size - sure, i said it was bigger than I expected, but the upside to this is that inside the unit there's a built-in surge protection circuit to help protect your gear. Belkin also attaches a $75,000 &#34;Connected Equipment Warranty&#34; just in case something bad happens, and the unit itself comes with a limited lifetime warranty as well.<br /><br />There are a couple little things that I wasn't so happy about feature-wise, but I didn't mind mainly because of how I personally was going to use it. For one, the two USB ports can do 5-volts at each port, but only 2.1-amps total. Some devices need at least 2.1-amps to charge as intended, so if you use both USB ports at the same time and your two devices need more than 2.1-amps total, they will still charge - but at a much slower rate. To some people this might be a problem, but for me I intended to use it as an overnight charger, so charge time wasn't an issue. The second thing is that it's only rated for 125V. I found this odd since it's called a &#34;travel charger&#34; and all of the travel charges I've seen are autovolt 110/220v, but then again I rarely travel outside the US so this doesn't affect my travels much.<br /><br />All in all it's a nice unit for me to take along on road trips, since I no longer need to try to find outlets in different areas of a hotel room to charge/power my gear. I don't even have to bring the individual devices USB chargers anymore thanks to the two built-in USB ports. For my purposes it works very well, and I was going to give it a 5 but because there are many people looking at this for travel purposes, I removed one star due to the lack of 220v capability.s I've seen are autovolt 110/220v, but then again I rarely travel outside the US so this doesn't affect my travels much.<br /><br />All in all it's a nice unit for me to take along on road trips, since I no longer need to try to find outlets in different areas of a hotel room to charge/power my gear.

"UPDATE 1/12/15 After using the headphones, for like 3 months or so, I finally see a crack at where the slider is supposed to be, this is such a dissapointment, I actually enjoyed these headphones apart from the annoying press on the ears, they sound pretty good, I take back what I said about the bass, these are Good sounding headphones BUT the build quality is horrible, if you want these to last you a couple of years, DO NOT buy these.  The headphones look great, the shipping was quick and the item came as the image. Came in it's own box, very big, with it's manuals, a cleaning cloth and two cables.  I'm only dissapointed on the sound quality from these, the bass is pretty out of reach. I'm amazed on the Noise Cancellation on these, when the muffs close on your ears, nothing can be heard outside, and at max volume, little to no noise, only if you come very close to the headphones, will you hear anything.  The earphones after some time of using, like 20-30 minutes or so begin hurting my ears, extremely annoying, might just be me but I'm disappointed.  The slider to increase it's height is harder to do on one said than the other and one side falls open when closed so easily.  Except from all that,  UPDATE: Finally cracked on the both sides where the sliders are supposed to be, so dissapointing, the sound quality is great, best bass I've heard in a while, unfortunately, the build quality is so bad the two sides where the sliders go have broken and gotten missing, so basically I have a naked slider, the muffs have began coming out and I can't seem to find any legit replacement.  UPDATE 3/2/2016: Well, now the sliders come out if you extend the sliders too up, the cable goes out as well, the plastic dissapeared and well, had to glue certain parts of the muffs, and others are opening up and showing the blue foam inside. This is horrible, extremely dissapointing considering it's price point.",negative
"I want to love this. The little unit sounds great. Battery life is good. Unit is really portable. But the USB jack is already wearing out after less than 3 months. This thing goes on and comes off a charging cable every day. I have to look for something else now. Sometimes I think this speaker is charging, but I go to use it and it's dead. It's definitely not the cable.",positive
"Loved the length of the cord. This cord does exactly what I hoping it would do. I run it from my router to my Xbox. It doesn't make me lag or anything. It's strong and durable. I have it going from the upstairs of my house to the downstairs, but I have it going outside my window into another window (crazy I know). It goes in a door frame that is shut and opened all day and it is still working. I received this months ago and it is still working great!",positive
"Previous reviews about current regulation are correct.  The current regulation is essentially not functional.  An amplifier on the board provides adjustable gain for the current sense feedback, where the gain is adjusted using the current trim pot.  Even with the gain turned all the way up, I can still draw all the current I want.  A larger current sense resistance would probably work to increase the feedback, but adding resistance in series with the power transistor reduces efficiency of the converter.<br /><br />Since I don't really need to limit the current in my application, the converter works fine for me.",positive
"This is wonderful! the remote makes it easier, so i can hide the cables and cords and still access the port.",negative
"I decided to get some more robust closed back headphones after breaking my grados several times, and closed back so I could use them outside my home.<br /><br /> I was expecting a dip in sound quality from the famed open backed grados, but was suprised to find the sony's comparable or maybe even superior. A little less clarity and sparkle on the highs, not much a closed back headpiece can do to compete with open backed designs in that regard, but everything else was as good or  better than SR60i. In retrospect it shouldve been obvious that the sound quality would be great as these headphones are a studio standard among audio pros and have been for decades.<br /><br />The build quality and durability of these headphones is unreal. All metal hinges and hardware, great cord, etc. I manhandle my headphones and travel with them to school and for domestic/international trips. Ive used and abused these for almost a year now and they still look literally brand new.<br /><br />I never review things but felt compelled to because I havent been this happy with a product in a while",positive

I must have missed the amperage rating when I bought it.  At 1 amp it is near useless. It won't charge my phone at all and my tables only get partially charged.<br />It is cumbersome as well. The spacer that is supposed to keep the edge away from the plug end is too short so the item is unstable once plugged in. It's basically an expensive 3 outlet AC extender at best.<br />I can't recommend it.,negative

"I got this speaker on a good discount, but I do not love it. The tone and bass are fine for a cheap speaker, but nothing to write home about. The battery life is nice, often lasting several hours even on Bluetooth. Speaking of Bluetooth, it is a pain to use on this speaker. Synching is not straighforward, it often loses it connection (which is tons of fun when then it reverts back to the loud internal laptop speakers unexpectedly), and the sound is terribly compressed. Overall, I would choose this speaker over, say, a pie tin, but not over much else",positive

"I received the first one with Prime and it was missing the accessories box including the power cable so I had to pack it up and ship it back so that is why this is 4 not 5 stars.  The unit is big and repacking and dragging it to the UPS store by myself was not easy.<br />Give yourself 4 feet wide and 2-2.5 deep to set this up.  I have a 36&#34; TV stand so this hangs over by 4&#34; on each side which does not affect anything. It still very stable  I use a 40&#34; TV right now for your knowledge.  I had been thinking of simplifying the sound system espically with the mish mash of speakers I have .  I was sceptical that this unit could deliver enough sound to make it in the ballpark of movie theater sound and play back recorded music whether from DVD or CD or digital. I have been pleasantly surprised by that. It sounds great although I do not thnk the bass is a powerful in the unit istelf.  It does accommodate a powered subwoofer so I hooked up my existing one to the unit and it sounds fantastic with the units speakers when i need the extra oomph especially for music. It is posible the first room I hooked up in swallowed a little of that but I am happier to have the subwoofer hooked up.  Your experience may vary so keep that in mind.  It has 3 separate surround modes each one varying the vocals and soundtrack/effects with 3rd being closest to the theater sound.  The one feature that is saving my marriage right now is the Accuvoice.  For normal TV viewing for sports sitcoms and other TV shows the Accuvoice allows you to hear the dialogue without turning up the volume to ungodly levels.  The output leveling seems to lower the volume.  I am still working with that feature so i have no further comment.  The other feature I love is the fact you can adjust your tone with the separate bass and treble controls something you just can't do with TVs at least the ones i own.  So the over all cost is about what you pay for a cheap high end surround system without all of the speakers and wires.  That is one thing I really like is how clean my setup is now.  I have one HDMI cable from the cable box to the TV, one.HDMI cable from the Blue Ray player to the TV, one HDMI cable from the ROKU to the TV (not a smart TV) then one digital output cable from the TV to speakers and one output line from the speakers to my subwoofer.

"It is nice for the price I guess. I put like 300 songs on the device, and it took a very long time to download them. Once I was finally done with downloading my music, I found that I couldn't make a play list on it. Even then, when certain songs play, the device will freeze up and stop working or reboot, and then I'd have to wait a moment for it to restart, and the volume controls are a little glitchy. Last but not least the touch screen functionality is very mediocre, you have to press the screen really hard, but when doing so you may accidentally press something you didn't want to press. All in all, if you want a music player to just have for music, or just to kinda toss around, or carry during your off time, it serves that purpose well. you probably wont miss it.",negative

Good speaker and I don't have to worry about leaving outside. But- this is not loud. The sound quality is good for what it is but I can sit next to it at max volume and it doesn't bother me- there also isn't any feedback or distortion- but it is not loud. It is a decent portable speaker.,positive
"Bought batteries together with the EBL 906 charger.  The charger would heat up the batteries to the point you couldn't touch them until they cooled down.  As a result one battery completely died after one charge.  Not sure if the problem was the battery or the charger, but both are by the same manufacturer.

The mp3 player by itself is a good product. It is solidly built and has a great battery life. The simple design makes it easy to use and has ample storage. Loading mp3 files onto the player is a breeze. It works just like a USB flash drive. The lack of a shuffle feature may be a problem when listening to music but it is perfect for listening to podcasts.<br /><br />My main issue with this product is the earphones. The sound quality is decent underwater when you can get them positioned right but it is hard to get them to stay in place. This is not a problem if you are lounging in the water but swimmers will find it very difficult to keep the earphones in their ears.,positive

"First, let me explain the choices I had at my BX (military shopping center) were these and Beats Studio. In fact the Inspirations were not on display like the beats or even on the same shelf as all the headphones and earplugs. I was doing research before coming to the base i was already looking getting Audio-Technica ath-m50x but then went to their anc9 and back and forth to anc7b but when I saw the Inspirations on the bottom of a side rack I started to look into them.   All the reviews said to that I would like the Inspirations. I went from having a cheap pair of Koss headphones to these and can't believe what I have been missing. The Inspirations sound beautifuly. Listening to some music and thought a gun was going off but it was a part of the track. I have never had this kind of experiance with headphones before. The reviews I read were right in that the noise cancling is good but could be better. There is no hissing with misic on like that of the Beats or Audio-technicas from what reviews have said. Comfort is fantastic despite everyone talking about how heavy they are. Honestly they don't feel heavy on my head even after wearing them for hours. As confortable as they are, head banging is out of the question. Just leaning forward a little I can feel them slip. My cheap Koss headphones I could headbang a little with barley an issue but after awhile they would slip off. I've found that sometimes when I re-plug in the cord I have to play with the cord in the headset to work in both ears. I'm glad that I got these and would recomended them. People may say I'm nuts and go look at Bose but I did briefly after most reviews were about how poorly constructed they are and their customer support is worse. I wrote the above before a plane ride. Now after taking a very long plane ride I have some issues. Before I left to the airport i noticed that half of the mic cover was gone. I would sum up the mic to poor quality. Now on the plane i noticed after the first hour and a half my ears started to hurt. They turned in half over and half on ear just to feel comfortable. If you have big ears do not buy these. The noise cancleing worked good enough to cancle most of the airplane noise and chatter. Overall, great headset for someone with small ears. Walking through the terminals i tried Bose QC25 and Audio-Technica ath-anc9. I almost bought the anc9's but didn't want to cary two high end headphones around.",negative

"I used this Antenna when I was in between cable services to pick up local channels.  I was able to get 18 channels crisp and clear.  I live in the city limits so I'm assuming I'm pretty close to my local stations.  The only time I wasn't able to pick up channels was if the weather conditions weren't perfect, like a cloudy day.  There is a dial on the back of the unit that allows you to fine tune the channel.  It made a little bit of difference if the channel wasn't coming in clear.  I had issues with my first unit so I reached out to customer support and they were very prompt in their reply.  They immediately sent out a replacement.

"This item is nice just from the standpoint that it gives you 4 more outlets in addition to the normal 2 on any home outlet. It works well for that use and it comes with a screw to make it stable in your outlet. My problem is with the USB ports. When I purchased this, I made sure to buy the more expensive item that advertised 2.1 amps USB so that I could charge my iPad. They must have had other complaints about this advertising since then because they have changed the description to read &#34;2.1 amps combined&#34;. Needless to say, this outlet will not completely charge my iPad overnight (6-7 hours). Does the fact that is says 2.1 amps combined mean that if I only use one of the USB ports it will draw the whole 2.1 amps and charge faster? I don't know, I haven't tried it. I use the other port to charge my iPhone overnight. It doesn't have any problems getting a full charge. Which is nice. The device is great if you need 6 plugs, which I did not. I just wish the description would have been accurate at the time so that I wouldn't have wasted the extra charge for 2.1 amps because it does not do what I bought it for. I could have saved money and bought the cheaper one. If you are looking for 2.1 amps to charge an iPad, keep looking. This device won't fill the bill.",negative

"Purchased the white 3-button SOL's about a month ago. Sound is great…with a few caveats:<br />1) remote acts possessed when exposed to sweat – for me, I run the cords inside my shirt to the shuffle clipped to my waist (keeps the cord noise down). After about 15 min. of running the remote gets damp with sweat and fast-forwards songs erratically until it is dried. I have two iPod shuffles and the SOL's audibly fast-skipped on them both.<br />2) could not get a good fit with the swappable 'plugs' on buds – probably due to my ears, but couldn't get the left side to fit well. Funny, I thought the sound was just &#34;ok&#34; on the SOL's until I yawned, changing the dynamics of my ear slightly. For about 5 seconds the sound was was awesome! Assuming they sound that way intentionally (and that my ear-fitting is atypical) the sound quality is quite good. My mileage varied.<br />3) remote is not detachable – this is a personal gripe, but I wish sport headphones would come with the option to detach the remote. The gym environment is not particularly healthy for cell phones and I leave mine in the locker. The remote can stay with it.<br /><br />I bought the SOLs to replace my BOSE SIE2's which finally developed a cord sheathing split after 3 years of continuous, hard use. IMHO, BOSE are the best overall if you are looking for sport headphones that last longer than a month. Will be shelving the SOLs for a pair of SoundTrues.",positive
Did a lot of research on line before I purchased. I could'nt be more satisfied. Not to mention buyin album's again has brought back great memories. Nothing like look and feel of real vinal disc's.,positive
"The audio quality for the price of these is very good. However, the left earbud started falling apart almost immediately - within 5 uses. They still work but I had to tape them together. Not cool for a new purchase!",positive
"The product worked great for one time. It ran for about 3 hours and now it won't charge.  As previous reviewers stated, I contacted the company since that's what the instructions said and received no reply.  I also bought the G-TUBE and I'm very happy with it.  It is louder than you'd think and the battery life well exceeded the G-Boom.",positive
"I bought these as a return and almost new, so for that discounted price they are OK. Sound quality a little disappointing but I run and I really hate to deal with a dangling wire down my back.  I did get these quick and they were all they were described to be. I am keeping them, I like the fact they are waterproof for rainy days. They will do the job, but not sure how impressed you would be.  I have now used these for a few weeks and would like to update my opinion...I do like these a lot more than at first. It comes with a lot of different size ear plugs and that's important because you have to really use these in your ears snug for the best sound. I usually don't like that but I found a small enough plug size that is not that bad. I ran in the rain yesterday and didn't have to worry about my player, that was nice. So I am liking these much more. They still wont be your best sounding player, but they are good enough and great for sports.",negative
"Very nice pre amp. It has lots of options, it powers all of my speakers without any problems. The cooling fan on the radio is not very noisy. It picks up fm signals very well even with the small antenna. I have not used the Bluetooth feature yet so I cannot review that part.",negative
"I'm basing this review after one hour of use. Fantastic! I never dreamed you could get this kind of sound out of a speaker the size of a baseball. Paired quickly, not a hitch. I'll take it on motorcycle trips and play my music at the motel. Takes up no room!",positive
"Bought a pair of these to act as a spare pair alongside the S4i that I bought a few years ago and keep at the office. The S4i are excellent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I find the sound of the R6i dreadful. Treble is almost absent with no detail at all, and bass is not particularly strong either. It's almost like listening to music whilst on hold to a telephone call centre - the sound is terribly compressed, lacking in space and sparkle. I have tried leaving them playing for an hour or so (which I shouldn't have to do and it's debatable whether it makes any difference). They have maybe improved marginally, but they are still very poor for the money.<br /><br />Maybe I've got a duff pair, so on that basis I'll be sending them back.",negative
"Even though the battery only lasts 3 hours it really was long enough for me, i don't listen to music all day usually but 3 hours is more than enough. I tested the product out as a free trial so i got to try it before i bought it. I wish i came in a different color though because i'm not in the Army i'm in the Air Force haha.",positive
"Tried using in a Toyota Sienna on a family trip.  It picked up much additional noise, static, hums, whatever.  Another cord (different brand) we had worked flawlessly with no added noise.",negative
Transmitter eats batteries like crazy. System doesn't work beyond about 15 ft else the headset screeches.  It does find the TV frequency okay (but must do a 'search' every time after you turn it on).  would not buy again at all. I can see why the mfg discontinued it.,positive
"Works well.  Had a few power lulls recently and unit cut off power immediately.  Wish there was an alarm sound when that happens to wake me when asleep, since it turns off the air conditioner and I'm not able to turn it back on until I awake.  I'm sure you can see the problem in that.  That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.",negative
"Glowing reviews and a promising list of features sold me on this Bluetooth speaker device, but problems emerged when I set it up and attempted to make full use of its abilities. My first unwelcome discovery was that its FM radio reception is mediocre at best; the NPR affiliate boomed authoritatively, but my favorite classical station was veiled in static like an orchestra playing behind a curtain of crackling cellophane. It's a pity, because the speakers themselves are excellent, very clear and powerful. Okay, I thought, we're still on the honeymoon cruise. A little static is no problem, like the room service meal arriving cold. We still have each other, babe.<br /><br />Ah, but then I found the auxiliary input jack to be nonfunctional. No signal. This honeymoon is going to s*** in a hurry. Not only did the food arrive cold, but it must have been sitting on the steamer table a bit too long and now my new wife is voiding her guts in the bathroom. Let's try the Bluetooth.<br /><br />Oh. Bluetooth works with only one of my phones, but as the ptomaine-afflicted spouse might say, &#34;Not tonight, dear.&#34; Yes, the speaker recognized the newer one, but would not connect to it, preferring instead to play selections from the Game of Thrones soundtrack from some undetermined, far away-sounding source.<br /><br />Fine then, honeymoon's over. This product is a dud. Maybe a lemon or design defect, don't care. I'll send this one back and try the competing Polaris model.",negative
Product as expected. Set up was relatively painless. Instruction was good. Good system for the price.,positive
"These stands work with the VIZIO speakers I got very well. The ONLY thing I had to do is widen the rear wire supports to make room for the RCA plug. Buy them for you're speakers as they are heavy cast iron, and absorb vibrations.",positive
The mount works really well. The reason for 3 stars is it didn't have very good instructions and tif your tv has hook ups on the back and not on the side it will cover them up. So depending on your TV it mite be what you are looking for.  Just keep in mind where your hook ups are before you buy.,positive
"My friend purchased this, she lives in el cajon CA which isn't far from a dozen stations but its surrounded by mountains between it and the xmitters. She has also had several antennas I gave her including amplified rabbit ears and a 10' piece of buss wire I formed into a loop about 30&#34; diameter.  I told her she needs a winegard amplified flatwave like I have but she won't listen and wants to try every sub $20 antenna she sees at big lots including this GE piece of dung. This antenna gets half the stations my $1 piece of wire did. GE must be laughing their way to the bank with this truly shameful performing product.<br />I give you my word purchasing this product is no better than using your money for toilet paper. You've been warned.<br />A decent antenna has to be larger than this it's a matter of physics having to do with the wavelength of the frequency you are trying to capture. The longest vhf wave is around 9 feet and if you aren't at least 1/8 the wavelength there's little chance of capture. 1/4 or 1/2 is better.<br />Spend s little more and accept that it's going to be something you see. Not tiny and cute. As stated I think the winegard flatwave amplified is a good choice. Very few antennas in the sub $20 range are acceptable, those that are will usually be the double rabbit ear type which are physically obtrusive but that's why they work.<br />Summary: GE antenna: Dung in a box that a monkey probably engineered by throwing darts at a board blindfolded.",positive
Would definitely not recommend this item to anyone. Stopped working within a month of usage.,negative

"Update on speakers.  Received the 3rd of August.  One is still amazing, the other sounds like a scratched record.  As with their policy, there's only 30days on returns.  But!  The company ordered from is one to stand behind their products.  So I'm staying with a 5 star.  The sound is amazing.  The connection is easy.  I would reorder these speakers, I would give them as gifts.  And in our Truck/Rv even one is awesome for music & books on tape.  I don't think you go wrong ordering these.",positive

"While these Philips SHQ2300LF/27 &#34;ActionFit Sports Earbuds&#34; are clearly marketed as a nice mid-range set of earbuds (not cheap $5 earbuds but not crazy expensive either), the simple fact is that these earbuds deliver terrible sound quality.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting these Philips earbuds to rival the premium earbuds from Sennheiser, Shure, or Audio Technica priced at more than $100, but given the retail price of these Philips earbuds I expected better quality than what I get from the free earbuds that I get on a long flight. Unfortunately, I put the audio quality from the Philips SHQ2300LF/27 earbuds on par with those free earbuds from airlines.<br /><br />I wouldn't call the audio &#34;unlistenable&#34; as other reviewers described, but the highs and midrange tones are shrill and distorted. You can hear and understand music or the audio from a movie, but it isn't very enjoyable. Bass is essentially absent when using these earbuds, so don't even think about using these if you're really into hip-hop, rap, funk, techno, dubstep, or anything with a prominent bassline. Honestly, that last bit makes this product less than ideal as &#34;sport&#34; or &#34;exercise&#34; earbuds. Likewise, if you're watching an action movie or horror film and using these earbuds the soundtrack and sound effects will sound tinny, hollow and lacking &#34;impact&#34; that typically comes from bass.<br /><br />These earbuds also suffer from erratic static problems depending on the audio source. I didn't have a problem with static disrupting the audio when I used these earbuds with my iPhone, but these Philips earbuds suffered from terrible static when I used them with my laptop, my Android tablet, and when I plugged them into a video camera to monitor the sound while recording. I double-checked the audio by plugging them into my iPhone and the static was gone again. In short, I wouldn't rely on these earbuds to deliver quality sound.<br /><br />If these earbuds were priced at $5.99 then you would know what to expect, but the MSRP for these Philips earbuds is $29.99 and that makes this a VERY bad deal. If you can find these on sale or as a free extra with the purchase of another item then they are fine. If you're paying full price then you should consider other earbuds like the Sony MDRXB50AP or the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC23.the MSRP for these Philips earbuds is $29.99 and that makes this a VERY bad deal.

"We needed to bridge our internet piped in sound via a PC to the sound system running our large entertainment center. We tried various PC's with different sound cards and a couple different USB based DACs and weren't impressed. All added coloration to some extent and sounded artificial. Given the sound processors on the front end of our building wide amplifiers have onboard DACs (good ones)  it eventually dawned on us to simply link the PC to the processors via SPDIF and let the rack do the conversion native with it's higher quality DACs. Problem is coax SPDIF out is increasingly hard to find on PCs, but the Muse solved the problem nicely. Unit detected in both Windows 7 and XP automatically and works flawlessly. It's also solidly built with a metal case. I'm not one to believe in all the jitter nonsense and that SPDIF conversions have different subjective sound characteristics. All that matters is having a solid, commercial/professional DAC and getting the data stream there. The Muse did this without fault.",positive

"Worked fine while it lasted. I like the thin flat cable. It just stopped working for me a few days ago, just under 9 months after purchase. I would lose audio unless I held the cable in a very specific position.<br /><br />I used this exclusively in my car, so heat may have been a factor. The cable sat in my car while it was 110°-114°F outside for over a week. That being said, I've had aux cables last for years in the same climate. Taking away two stars for poor build quality. Worked perfectly fine for 9 months and it was cheap.",negative
"&#34;IT DOESN'T FIT&#34; &#34;I FIXED IT&#34; I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED LIKE MANY OTHERS FOR THE HEAD NOT SEATING ALL THE WAY IN TO MY VIZIO TV'S OPTICAL PORT.

"I had two players now, which gives some points of comparison.<br /><br />I used this player and the &#34;Diver (TM) Waterproof MP3 Player with LCD Display&#34;.<br /><br />The Sony Walkman has the advantage of being in one piece, which means you don't have to plug anything to it when swimming. It is also light and compact. This has drawbacks too, though: first, it always gets entangled in everything that come in contact with it (my goggles, my swimming bag,...). Second, if you have small ears, the Sony will not fit well, and you spend about 1/4th of your time readjusting it. After 30 minutes, it starts aching, because the pressure on your ears becomes too strong. I also find it difficult to operate, since it has no LCD display.<br /><br />The &#34;Diver (TM)...&#34; is more classic: you have a player, to which you connect your waterproof earphones. These have buds of different sizes, and there is one size that fits my (small) ears :). It fits my head much better, does not hurt, and is easier to operate. The main two issues I have with this one are (1) the first player I had did not work well, and I had to return it. Apparently, they fixed the problem: the company had great service: they returned the new model immediately, kept inquiring about whether the new one worked better, and offered to replace it again because of one quibble I had. The one I have now works great. (2) The player does not play mp4 files; only mp3 and wma (who's still using these???).<br /><br />In both, the sound is OK, but not outstanding.<br /><br />All in all, although it looks a bit old fashioned, I thus prefer by far the &#34;Diver (TM)&#34;.",negative
"Well, when i first got it, it was with hope of helping the deficiencies in the MOHU Sky 60 reception. It didn't help much at all. Not the device's fault. The MOHU just quit doing what it used to do.

Also, using the FM radio will<br /><br />Recommended uses: with your own earbuds this is a pretty good budget mp3 player. Also, the voice recording (.wav format) makes this a good journalists interview tool. Since the screen times out once it starts recording voice there's no way anyone would even know you're recording. I have to knock off 1 star for a very odd quirk in voice recording. The FIRST file recorded seems to be full of static. All subsequent files are crystal clear.<br /><br />The earphones are pretty low-end. If you've got a reasonable plug-in pair of better earbuds (I've got a Sony set) the music quality is as good as any MP3 players. This is NOT a review of the headphones, just a &#34;heads up.&#34;<br /><br />The only video format supported is amv so if you want to convert your own vids you'll have to get a converter. Again, just a &#34;heads up.&#34;<br /><br />Finally, the manual is way too tiny. In any case, just playing with the controls isn't that hard. If you're not used to doing that, you might want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, these are pretty useful cheap gadgets. Quality control will be an issue since these are flooding the market. Some individual units may end up being great. Others, not so much. The free sample I received was in-between.<br /><br />Just as a vanilla MP3 player that you're not paranoid about losing, works great. Why 5 out of 5 stars? I'm an unabashed fan of cheap Chinese tech junk and my personal pref is &#34;I love it.&#34; But take the specific points I've brought up in this review to make your own decision.",positive

"I did not buy from Amazon, but wanted to share my experience with this charger, which I will be returning. You have to be aware of noise issue. This charger has two small fans that are constantly switching on and off. They are small and have high rpms with high pitch sound and you get used to it, but because they stop every 3-4 minutes for 20 seconds you always notice them restarting. Hugely annoying. They are noisier than my 17 inch laptop fans. Additionally the battery capacity test is inaccurate. I have an older version, an Opus BT-C2400 charger, and it gives me constant readings, properly refreshing batteries and reading 10-15% more capacity after a refresh. This charger seems to have a random number generator inside. Maybe I got a lemon, but I would double check your readings independently before you start disposing perfectly good batteries. The old charger was much better, no noise, no springs, accurate readings, came with D-cell adapters that fit well and did not fall out, etc. etc.",positive
"I've had three Walkman players. NWZ-S545 which is now unuseable and the latest NWZ-E-385 which quit on me yesterday. Computer won't recognize the unit now. I have another I bought for my Wife NWZ S-54?? that is an 8 gig. I depend on these units for music review and learning, as this has been a great resource to have on hand. However, the software Sony puts out with these units is not transparent, meaning, it takes some exploration to understand the quirks that make it work. Files have to be converted to work with these units. Sometimes what seems to be a normal Windows Media player file will not work and if you load it on the unit, it will not show up in the list or play. Some folders when loaded from a computer will be confused with another name and until you disconnect the unit from the computer they will not show up. Also in some instances the unit will show 2 files for the same alphabetical listing in two different places in the stack, and out of alphabetical order. No rhyme or reason. All of these quirks are tolerable if the unit works well. They typically have lasted about 1-2yrs and then they are trash. I use mine extensively and don't really have the time to buy another one and reload 16gigs of music only to have the unit shut down when I need it most. It takes a long time to find convert and load all of the music I work with on one of these units, and perhaps  1-2 yrs is all I can expect, but there is not way to predict when it will quit. The drivers and the software usually seem to be the issue, and/or how the hardware is programmed. I hesitated buying this one, and expected it to last a little longer than the last one, but,,,,,, Be warned, if you use it as much as I do, it may not last beyond a year, and of course the warranty is only 90 days.

There was something off about the carriage. It did not fit into the slot for which it was intended.,negative
Best deal on Amazon for plug adapters for Europe.  We used all 4 of them for all our electronic gadgets. Hotels in Europe typically don't have enough electrical outlets for our modern world so it is nice they have 2 ports.,positive

"For someone that is very into saving money, antenna is the only choice for me as cable and dish fees are out of this world. However I have tried many antennas and not all of them work. I bought this rotating antenna in hopes that it would be the one for us. We are in a rural area so there are lots of trees and not always easy to get a good signal. This antenna must be super powerful as I was picking up a good amount of clear channels with it just setting on my front porch! I can not wait to see what we can pickup when we put it on the roof.<br /><br />However the rotating part does not work. I can feel it trying to turn but something must be busted as it will not move. I contacted the seller and they sent out another one right away, only to have it be the same way. Plus both of the ones that I received looked like they have been used before.<br /><br />You will also want to be sure to carefully open the box. All of the nuts and bolts are not in a bag and just loose in the box. So you can have one fall out and be lost if you are not careful.<br /><br />If you are looking for a antenna that picks up clear channels, this may work for you as it does for me. But if you are buying it to get the rotating feature, don't count on it working.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided with a discounted or free product for my honest review of this item. This did not influence my thoughts for the review. All opinions are 100% my own.",positive
"Got the headphones to review, and was not happy at first. I planned to use these with my work radio, but when plugged in, they were way too loud (even when lowering the volume) and I felt like they were going to blow. They made the audio transmitted very unclear. So, I put them in my pocket and took them home. When plugged into my phone, they make a slight background noise. This has never happened with other headphones (even double checked after this pair did it). I then plugged them into my computer, and put on some Spotify. They are good quality through my computer I plan to use these tonight through my phone to see if the noise goes away. Despite the two problems I had, they are good headphones for the price. They free durable and strong. The cord doesn't tangle, and is long enough for any of my uses (even when using my work radio, something I often have problems with)",negative
"I want to get a decent earbud+mic for listening to the music at work instead of the ATH-M50X , just changed job LOL so I decided to get this one from a deal. I also own the 3 more earbuds (Sennheiser CX300 II, CX380II, a Sony and Apple from iphone 6) and they are good and still working after 4 years. In comparison to those earbuds I mentioned, the Polk audio sound cleaner with adequate bass but it's tricky to get bass. I will talk about that later.<br />Some reviewers complained about the volume is not loud enough and I found the same. I have to crank up the volume quite a bit if I want to get the same loudness with the others. Even my ATH-M50X which is rated at the same 32Ohms also sounds much louder. After two days my ears adjusted and I didn't have to turn up the volume as much and I don't think I can go to max with Iphone/Ipod. So If you play that loud then your ears are having problem. I found the Sennheiser CX380 and the Sony with angle design fit my ears best. If you don't insert correctly then you will get bass at all, i really mean zero bass. I tried so hard and I then followed the instruction from the booklet to get the decent sound. First, you need to insert the earbuds to your ear canels with the wing point down then twist them up , CW direction, about 90degrees. Now, you can enjoy the music. The high and the mid are quite good and the bass is decent and deep and no distortion at all. I tried the song Halo and it sounds really good and none of my earbuds sound can compared.<br />Since you do that, it's very hard to take the earbuds out and make sure you don't just hold the cord to yank them out because the cord is super<br />slim.",positive
"Sound quality is underwhelming. Style and fit are amazing, unfortunately the listening experience is lacking.",positive
"It does not work well when connected : a DVD , CABLE TV and one wii games, the TV does not work , spend uselessly .",negative
"I would've loved these headphones, but for some reason my Galaxy s5 won't recognize them so they are pretty much useless to me. I tried them through my friend's iPhone though and they have a really nice sound.",negative
"Built a diy power supply with it using a 24v 15A supply and drok meter/current board, so far so good. Used a dual wiper 10k pot with its wipers in parallel for 5k max on the voltage pot. My DIY variable supply will go up to 19V max, unsure on peak current. Have not had it over 2A constant/6ish in-rush.<br /><br />Have had bad luck with other modules in the past..  exploding caps etc.<br /><br />This one seems to be relatively simple and well designed.",positive
Just had my second one fail on me. The first one was my fault because I broke the charging port by pulling on the charging cable by accident. The second ones pause/play button randomly stopped working ~2 months of use.,negative
Construction of this adapter is mediocre. It was cheap to buy so I did not expect much from it. It seems to muffle the sound a little.,negative
"I usually like Philips products. . .  but this one is not one of those.  There is absolutely no bass from these headphones.  None. . . zilch. . . nada. . . . zip.  Never in my life have I ever used headphones that have zero bass.  I’ve used plenty that didn’t have a lot.  But this is the first that has absolutely none.  I like the design. . . I like the feel. . . I like everything about them.. . but without bass, they are really useless to me.",negative
Bought two. One dead on arrival the other intermittant connection.  Will return both and try another brand.,positive
Sound quality is decent.  Unfortunately the ability to use it to talk on the phone stopped working after about 2 months.  I wouldn't buy these again.,positive
It would play several songs and then it would stop without any reason.  Tried changing CD's (originals - not copies) but it kept on doing the same thing.  The CD I received was also sensitive to movement; easy to skip while playing.  Had to return it and got credit for it.  Very disappointed ... I thought Jensen made quality products.  Maybe the one I received was a lemon???,negative
"You will love these when you buy them.  They work exactly as advertised.  The &#34;aware mode&#34; is a great innovation.  I have owned two pairs and the same thing has happened with each.  A few months after purchase, the &#34;aware mode&#34; switch stops working.  Everything else about them is fine, but no more ability to switch off noise cancelling.  The little switch that controls &#34;aware mode&#34; is just not very durable and sooner or later it will fail. After you have gotten really used to it.  *Sigh*",positive
"one lens had a scratch, and the ring magnet was missing, so I could not use the magnetic switch. Otherwise, if it had all parts, it is a good design and should function well. I'm returning this one and reordered another one to give Trusted Toronto another chance.",positive

"It's definitely worth the price. The sound quality is good. I was expecting the mic to be a little better, but it still outperforms similar items that cost a bit more.",positive
"working good in my headlamp and recharger. they seem slightly less bright and powerful compared to the 2600mah one i purchased, but i am not complaining.  Run times are good and worth the money",positive
It fell apart and never worked.  This was a total BUST!,positive
"I'm sure it works well with other products but it did not work or fit well with mine, and for that reason I'm giving it a 3 stars",positive
The headphones are a real disappointment. They do not stay in your ear. The hook is very flimsy as well. If you sweat a lot the volume control is damaged and will stop the headphones from playing.,negative
"I usually wet my ears a bit so that the seal on my CIEMs are better.  I used a JH5 customer IEM with a nice Whip audio copper cable (sounds great!).  I was given a sample with another CIEM that I own so I wanted to try it on my JH5s.  It's a small trip of comply material with a sticky strip.  I wrapped it around the protruding area of the CIEM and it seemed to seal pretty well although not as good as wetting my ears a bit.<br /><br />Here's the problem, after maybe around 10-12 times using it, the sticky part comes off the comply part and it leaves a sticky residue on my CIEMs.  You can rub it off but it means I have to use another wrap.  This is only after a few weeks of use.<br /><br />Here's the run down:<br />PROs:<br />- good alternative to getting a seal rather than wetting the ears<br />- good concept<br /><br />CONs:<br />- doesn't last long as the sticky residue comes off<br />- need to fiddle with the placement<br />- seal not as good as wetting the ears<br /><br />I will not purchase additional wraps as it needs more thought and improvement",positive
The wireless receivers work ok the majority of the time but are sensitive to interference.,negative
"Great earphones for the price. The pickup on the mic is apparently great, so consider how you plan to use the product--it seems to have minimal background noise suppression (I use these for phone calls at the office and people on the other end of the call complain about hearing co-workers talk in the background). My only complaint is that the wires lack insulation--the earphones are incredibly susceptible to noise from the wires rubbing against your shirt or anything else. Quite annoying as you move around, so I hold the wires away from my body if I'm using these while walking around.",positive
longest cables i have seen worked great and way less exp than i ever thought,positive
It works pretty good but it's a little slow. Holds a lot of songs and has a good sound quality.,positive

"Could not open battery compartment. Unfortunately, I waited too long before opening and using these headphones. I no longer can return these. I just wasted 50 bucks.This is junk. Do not buy.",negative
Does not stay clipped well and slides down cord too easily,positive
"The charge doe not hold long enough for me to complete my workouts, which are about 1-2 hours in length.  A real bummer, because I really enjoy the no long cord attached to my phone feature.",positive
Batteries worked great for about a year. After that they wouldn't hold a charge very long.,positive
"The Sound is great, they're very stylish and the ear cups are very comfortable. The cord is tangle free and the remote works well. The only downside for me is the weight; it's a little bit on the heavy side and it doesn't stay as secure as I'd like.",positive
"sounds great for the price, but 12 hours play time is laughable (unless mine is defective)...i get *maybe* 3-4 hours on a full charge playing Pandora through bluetooth via my Samsung Galaxy S5.",positive
Power pack has failed. So whole item is now useless. Returns ran out after 30 days!!<br /><br />Not as good as the original. Bass is looser. Not as well built.,positive
My son loves buying different cases and had to have this one.. He approves!,positive
Easy to mount under a kitchen cabinet. Fair reception. Sounds good. Fiddly too-small tuning buttons. Impossible to pre-set stations. Useless instructions.,positive

I love it but the description says it's blue and it's actually red.,positive
"Just installed these. The 'skirt' that fits into the groove on the headphone shell is considerably wider than the original so they look a little different when installed but it means they are a little deeper overall and my ears no longer touch the driver, which is nice and makes them more comfortable for me, despite being made of thicker material. Overall they seem fine - the only thing I found a little offputting was the strong plastic/chemical smell that is currently coming off them. Hoping that this will dissipate over time.",positive
purchased on 4/26 by 7/10 it no longer works or charges. I wonder why it was returned and refurbished.,negative
I'm very interested in purchasing this device because I believe my girlfriend is going somewhere other than what she tells me when I leave for work at night an I just want to make sure this device will work 100% effectively of stored in one of the cases an mounted to her vehicle.

"Have just received mine (In the UK) after being told only a few days ago they'll ship it out, so excellent dispatch and delivery.  Came in a very secure long cardboard box, inside a basic brown posting cardboard box.. Not a single dent anywhere! I didn't use the instructions (typical man) but it was quite straight forward and simple how to make it do what you want it too. (I.E: Volume up/down, BlueTooth, Radio) But had a quick look through the instructional book (Which also has very clear instructions, so for people who aren't very 'gadgety', don't worry) and found out it has an Alarm clock, which is obviously a very handy feature which is just a simple high pitched *Beep beep beep beep..*. But can be set to your own music using a TF or Flash Disk and the Radio  The outer casing for the speaker is plastic (But by all means don't be discouraged, it feels and looks great) with small rubber strips hidden underneath to give it support and keep it extra stable. Metal mesh along the front protecting the speakers.  L.E.D screen is clear, has a clock, and shows icons to whats being used, such as the Bluetooth or Alarm clock.  It also comes with a Micro USB & 3.5mm Audio Cable, mine also came charged, so was ready to use straight out the box!  Performance wise, the music is clear, has a decent amount of bass (Personally think it sounds particularly brilliant with Rock and Trance music.) It states a charge can last 10-15 hours off a 5 hour charge, I genuinely believe this speaker is underpriced, it truly is a great piece of kit.  Supporting Bluetooth, Aux, TF Card & USB Flash Disk.. This speaker can easily be used at home or when taken to a party (It will be popular!)  Any questions about this item feel free to ask me, I'll do my best to answer them as I can :)",positive
This is the closest thing I've found to a classic DiscWasher. Works great and I use it all the time on my LPs,positive
These are still working 23 months later. That's unheard of for an AUX cable for me. I usually go through a couple a year.,positive
Good product but not very durable.  Be gentle and its great.  Good sound.,positive
Very uncomfortable product<br />i threw it to the rubbish bin,negative

"I got this so I could switch between my computer monitor and my ps4 without messing with cables all the time, but when the ps4 tries to go through the splitter I just get static, no idea why, but it just doesn't work with the ps4, which was the whole reason I wanted it.",negative
I love these headphones. At this price point they should include a shorter cable. It's an easy fix but that's an extra i would have been willing to pay if they were included.,positive
"Usable, but low quality. The boards most likely won't allow any rework, given the very thin traces. Traces are so thin that some actually bubble on the surface. I wouldn't use these on anything but low power circuits, or better yet - get higher quality boards",positive
"UPDATE: These headphones have poor build quality for their price point.  The $6 pair of panasonic headphones I use at the gym are more robust.  The headphone jack &#34;cap&#34; came off after ~4 months. Now, after 7 months, the jack was bent by by the cord getting caught on a handle while in use.    No longer recommend Comply Tx-200 earphone tips due to very poor build quality.  ORIGINAL: I bought a refurb pair for ~$50. At that price these are fantastic ear buds. Sound great, good bass response etc.  Recommend buying Comply Tx-200 earphone tips to greatly improve the sound.  I would not buy these at the new item price, $150, definitely not $120 better than the cheaper version, which I also owned. (minus one star)",negative
great! my sister loved it. And she never really say anythign is good. Skull candy is a good brand to buy from. Beats&#60;Skull Candy,positive
"I've been a longtime Skullcandy user, and continue to use them as headphones of choice, but seeing the new Strum touting the &#34;Best Fit Ever&#34; tag, I figured I should give these a shot over the tried-and-true 50/50s and Titans.  There's a little bit of regret, but in the end, these are pretty good headphones.  I'm just glad I didn't pay $50 for them.<br /><br />The build quality has gone down considerably and especially compared to Titan or 50/50 earbuds, and that was noticed right out of the box.  The new plastic case is also not my favorite--I miss the old mesh ones, personally.<br /><br />Sound wise, I was underwhelmed.  The bass was okay, the mids were a little drowned out, and the highs were scrubby.  It just sounds... cheap.  The Mic2 setup also feels cheap (Also--really? A slider? On earbuds?) although it is nice to control my Droid Turbo without issue.<br /><br />The best part--and the only part that sets these earbuds above anything I've tried on before, they are remarkably comfortable.  They fit perfectly into my often too oddly shaped ears to be comfortable, but it feels like they're not even there.  For that alone, they are worth a good looking-at.  Nothing compares that I have tried, honestly.<br /><br />All in all, the comfort is king here and what probably draws people to these anyways.  If you don't mind not having top-notch sound, then by all means, these are the buds for you.  Expect to feel a little cheated by the build quality of the buds EXCEPT for at the ear, where it counts anyway.  Worth a look at, I just wish they sounded like the similarly priced Skullcandy earbuds.",positive
"I first saw this speaker on Kickstarter and though it looked great - I was excited to purchase it once it arrived on Amazon.  The speaker has adequate build quality, the rubber band surrounding the unit is very easily removable and kind of loose.  The sound quality is OK for a Bluetooth speaker.  I wasn't expecting something fantastic, but there are other similar sized speakers which sound better, in my opinion.  Sticking the speaker close to a wall makes it sound better since the sound comes out both sides and can bounce off the wall.  I do take it on trips so I can play music in the hotel room.<br /><br />Overall this purchase was OK.  I understand that this is/was a fledgling company and initial products might not turn out exactly how they planned.  If this item broke or was damaged I'd think twice about purchasing again - maybe a newer item from the same company though.",positive
"I love these headphones. I've had a pair for years and they are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. For comparison, I'm a hobbyist pilot and have a pair of $1200 Bose for the cockpit, and they don't even come close to the Skillcandy Aviators in terms of comfort (yes I know the application for the headphones are quite different). I also have a set of SkullCandy Hesh2's which are not nearly as comfortable as these.<br /><br />Sound quality is very good as well. Might be slightly bass heavy, but that is common today in consumer headphones. I'm no audiophile, though.<br /><br />I love these headphones so much I event purchased a set as a gift! I am sad to see that these are discontinued, and am thinking about picking up another set before they disappear for good. Wish SkullCandy would make a version of these in Bluetooth!",positive
"I have two of these cables. Been using for years and I haven't had any issues. I use them with the Apple TV, PS3, and the SONY home theater.",positive
"Very poor quality, mine came with flat battery, had to purchase a new one. Months later DAC died. Pure crap.",negative
"Get what you pay for. Using new Duracell batteries I could not get it to stay on longer than 1 minute, kept going off saying low battery.",negative
I would not buy this product because it lasted three weeks. Then it just died! Never dropped it. Always very careful in handling it because it felt cheap and flimsy. I was able to down load about 250 songs on it. The battery won't recharge either?? I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Save a few extra dollars and buy an iPhone Touch.,negative
Compact and easy to use.  Could plug in two things at the same time.  Worked very well in Paris.,negative
"Sound is ok - but forget it for blocking outside sound.  Bought these for the plane - can still hear all the conversation, rumble, etc.  Should have bought the Bose.",negative
The sound quality is pretty good. However I have had technical issues with it. It will consistently skip on every record I have a little past halfway through. Technical issues happen and that is fine but Sony has a TERRIBLE customer service provider. They take forever to get back to you and will make you pay 40 dollars to have them look at it even though I've only had it for 1 year. Just gonna look for a new turntable,negative
It works but is outdated.  I can't put in the decimal for the channel and my TV won't accept a channel without a decimal so I have to use the channel up/down buttons.  It was ok for a substitute until we found the original remote again.,positive
"I would love these if only they were more robust. The higher voltage worked well with the old flash they were powering. The faster recycle time was a real bonus, but they just don't hold up over time and are extremely sensitive to being fully discharged or left unused for a period of time. They also seem to have a fairly high self discharge rate. That they are environmentally friendly is a green feature. These would be good for applications where you need higher voltage, never fully discharge, do not need to hold a charge over weeks.",positive
"Horrible, horrible fm reception.  I guess it could be defective, but just seems like it loses the fm signal from nearby stations almost immediately after pulling them in.  Even with antenna fully extended, just terrible reception.  Am is useless as well.  Sound from my iPhone is better as well.  Not even worth the $20 I spent on this.",negative
These are pretty good and block out noise very well. Unfortunately the jack plug doesn't last more than 4 months before cutting off. Why can't they make an indestructible jack plug?,positive
"These are great headphones. I love the look and the sound and the cushioning, but they were just way too tight on my head. I have an average sized head, I think, and I just couldn't wear these for more than an hour (at most) at one time.",positive
Definitely not what they say they are. They are not 'over-the-ear'. They are 'ON-EAR' headphones. I took a chance that Amazon had listed a really good product. That if it is part of their 'Deal of the Day' that they had verified that the product was what it says it is. I have had other ON-EAR headphones and for me after about an hour they make my ears sore. If I wanted sore ears I could just stick with crappy ear buds.<br /><br />I guess I could give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that Bendio is actually a company started by Hobbits and their quality control all have small ears.,positive
"No matter how clean your ears are, gunk always gets on the inside of the buds. This isn't a knock to this product in particular, just a generalized observation. I have very small ears and the small pads fit just fine. Sound quality is what you'd expect and noise cancellation is pretty good.",positive
"Product is fine, Nothing amazing. Lots of strange beeps and noises come out of it. Instruction manual is weak so I just hit buttons until the things stops beeping. I'm pretty sure the beeping is due to a search for blue tooth device but not 100% sure. One bad thing is that if you have it connected to your computer for both charging (USB) and speakers (Headphone jack) there is an ANNOYING buzzing sound. Buzzing sounds only goes away when fully charged or you disconnect the USB. Haven't tried the waterproof thing yet. Sound is good.",negative
"Love this for my multiple cords, but doesn't fit everything shown on front. As in, the slots would not be big enough etc.",positive
One of the best headphones i have ever tried the bass response is on point the treble is beautiful the lows the mids everything is just where it should be and with the added bonus of fast shipping and a kind seller,positive
Good product. However it does not have a &#34;power indicator light&#34;. I would buy it again,positive
Perfect for running...It just takes a while to figure out how you want them to fit in your ear,positive
Was not comfortable for my ear size.... I think this best suits people with smaller head circumference and also I wear glasses and it didnt feel comfortable with these on for longer durations.,positive
Bought this for my work van. Not enough volume and using the phone is horrible.,positive
"This isn't for a home theater system, these are just supplementary speakers for your phone or computer/laptop. It doesn't get very loud at all.",negative
worked 5 minutes now seems to have wheel issue/ guess you get what you pay for?,positive
It degrades the HD video quality to what the old DVD's rca video output used to look like.,negative
Failed within few hours of purchase. It stopped connecting to compatible bluetooth devices.,positive
"Wow this is a great Bluetooth speaker. Especially for its price. The sound is incredible. There is no need to look further than this Sony. The NFC function is such an amazing feature. I don't think the Bose soundlink mini's sounds quality exceeds this device's sound. When it comes to speakers I want the best sound and I don't really care about all the extra features. So, it's not super light, I don't mind sacrificing weight for sound.<br />Update!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />After a year and a half the speaker doesn't charge anymore. The speaker was never abused and for it to stop working is absurd. I called Sony and they claimed since it is out of warranty they cannot help me. Why should I buy another Sony product, if this breaks only after a year and a half?!!!! Horrible costumer support they made me call three different numbers before they said there is nothing they can do. I will never recommend Sony again and regret making others buy this product. Uprofesional for them not to address and help resolve the problem.",negative
Bought this for my 6 y.o. - very pleased with product for the price. would buy again.,positive
"Very disappointed. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and it doesn't work. While searching for hints, I saw the bad reviews...",negative
"Fast shipment. Fits perfectly and doesn't fall out!  Great sound, love it!",positive
Does the job but a bit cheaply made for the price IMHO,negative
It would not hold the angle in which I tried to adjust my TV. Maybe mine is too heavy but otherwise no complaints.,positive

They work but seem not to be heavy duty construction.  Switch does not light up to tell you whether it is on or off. You get what you pay for.,negative
"This Remote Control unit was used one .  The Remote control function for My LG TV was OK.  However, The case was scratched and dirty that never even cleaned.

"Sound is great, callers can barely hear when u talk",positive
"The sound quality is pretty good for the price.  However, when I plug the earphone into my mp3 player, if I push the plug in all the way, only one ear will have music.  I have to pull it slightly out to get it to work... and it can get quite difficult to find just the right depth.  Then, if I move the mp3 play around a bit, it'll lose contact and it'll feel like your hearing went out or the music becomes very soft.  Too bad.  I've used many different ear buds and this one is the worse.  I have three different mp3 players and they all have this problem with this earbud.<br />  Also, when I jog or do jumping jacks with the earbuds in my ear, I can really hear the cables banging against each other.  They need to use a different material for the cables.<br />One star added because of the quality of the sound.. for the price.",negative
This was exactly what I needed.Great design and construction! Highly recommend tis product.,positive
"Didn't work well, couldn't hear anything and does not fit in my ears or anyones ears.",positive
"Worthless. Tested with known good satellite signal & equipment and got no alarm or signal indication on the meter. Don't waste your money.<br />The company did refund my purchase without issue or delay, however.",positive
The sound is crystal clear & bass is great for this size. The top surface looks strong & beautiful. It sound much better than Yamaha sound bar.,positive
"I could not even try these on, they were far too small for my head. I typically have this problem, but JLab seems extreme in all of their headphones only fitting people of average height or smaller (tall folks tend to have larger heads), as these were way off, far too small.",negative
"I never left this review originally.  Sorry, I have made sure it will never happen again.   I have never bought these from Amazon.  The VTC(4's or 5's) I have bought have been good, but there is such a MASSIVE amount of very questionable information, regarding these batteries, going on all over the internet, I for one can not make any kind of intelligent decision regarding these.  Encompass did tell my wife to go to Amazon, Encompass is Sony Electronics parts distributor.  But I think they simply looked on Google, like everyone else.",positive
Cable attachment broke on 2nd time attaching cable.,positive
This 2 way HDMI switch works great so far.... I needed 1 in 2 out for my application.... I would give it 5 stars if all 3 input/output ports were on the same side.... I don't like the way it looks when the cables are hooked up... But it does work as advertised and solved my specific problem....,positive
"I initially really enjoyed these headphones. Clear enough sound and comfortable. However, a few weeks after the 90-day warranty expired, the sound cut off to one side. Now I only hear out of one side and I can't do anything about it. You get what you pay for, I guess.",positive
"It didn't really add anything to my reception. I checked two areas that i at least recieved 4 channels,  but now I did get any.  I check a couple more campgrounds this summer.",positive
"It is much smaller than I anticipated. I don't know how they expect you to put a full size DVD player or VCR on there. I just have a Charter HD receiver on there and thats about all the room it has.

Though the USB is advertised as 1 AMP (the same as a standard iPhone charger) the truth is buried in the fine print: It's actually 500mA per port. iPads and the iPhone 6/6 Plus can accept 2.1A so this thing, if it will charge your device at all, may take four times as long. Even with older model iPhones, it's still going to charge at half the rate of the included charger.",negative

"I did have to buy M4 screws for this mount to attach to my TV (32&#34; Vizio LED), but the trusty local orange big box hardware store had the right size for a grand total of $1.64 + tax. The screws that came with the mount for attaching to the wall were 100% perfect for attaching to a stud.  Which raises the point addressed in other reviews, where I will ask: WHY IN YOUR RIGHT MIND WOULD YOU INSTALL A FLAT SCREEN TV, WEIGHING DOWN A HORIZONTAL TV MOUNT, ADDING SHEARING GRAVITATIONAL FORCE TO THE EQUATION, *ONLY* TO DRYWALL!?!? If you're installing a TV wall mount - *ANY* TV wall mount - install it in a stud. They're only 18&#34; apart and these types of TV mounts will easily span that difference in adjustability. There is just no logical reason whatsoever to use drywall alone. DRILL IN TO A STUD, PEOPLE!  It did take a while for me to install, probably about 2 hours - but that was complicated because I didn't notice that the mount could be adjusted for horizontal tilt just by adjusting the top two TV screws, and I kept trying to get the mount centered on the wall. Lesson learned for your advantage: the mount does NOT need to be perfectly level on the wall when you screw it in. There is probably about 5, maybe 10 degrees of adjustment built in to the part where the TV is attached to the mount, by loosening the top two bolt heads, lining the TV up, and tightening them back down.  Because it was my fault for not noticing that adjustability, I can't subtract any points from the unit review. User error all the way. Once I got it tightened down (by the way, I used a shim between the mount and the wall to introduce about a 10 degree downward angle, so the TV is easier to see from our bed - it worked perfectly!), this unit lived up to well beyond what we paid for it.  Short story: 100% recommended.",positive
"As far as blue tooth goes - it connects, but sound quality is poor/often full of static. Use a cord to connect to a device & sound volume/quality is acceptable.",negative
"Sounds great and is definitely water proof. Did a 30 second soak test in the sink as soon as i got it and it came out playing just as well and as loud as before.

The set up is not easy, and the Owners Manual,  which you have to get off the Yamaha website, is poorly written. As far as I can find, their is no Yamaha customer service. Its going back!  Well, I sent it back the next day, and have been fighting Amazon for a refund ever since! They finally agreed that I was due a refund, but they now insist that the only way I can get a refund is as a credit to the credit card I used to purchase this POS.

"I will be critical of this product, even though I like it very much.  First,  this is one of the only combination charger / powerbanks that are out there right now and works.  It is a small package and performs well.<br /><br />As a powerbank, I like that I can use my 18650 cells to charge my phone about 50% on one battery.<br /><br />The disappointment is that the charger is rated to be 1 amp.  I have not got that on any cell I have tried to charge in the CH1.  I get between 0.66 and 0.68 amps.  Now, this is alright, but for the large 18650 3400 mah cells, this charger will take quite a while to charge them.  Given, this is a travel / secondary charger for me, I still would like the batteries to charge at the stated 1 amp rate.<br /><br /> Also, the charger gets pretty hot near the input of the micro usb connection.  Being a small unit, the whole device heats up pretty quick and may diminish charge quality.<br /> Again, I am being critical, as I like this product very much.  I carry it everyday in my bag for use as a powerbank, if needed.  It is also my backup 18650 charger if I am away from my home charger.<br /><br />For most people, I believe that they will use this as a backup or on-the-go charger.  This charger works very well for that purpose and I would recommend it for that use.  I do not believe, from my research, that there is a better charger / powerbank out there of this variety at this time.<br /> I would not recommend this as a primary charger for your 18650s, though.",negative
the antenna was not what amazon said it would be like. Amazon has got to take resoniblity for what they put out there. The antenna only opens up to 5 inches.

I was planing an outdoor private event and I was seduced by the wireless concept of this product as I wanted to suround a pool. I bought 4 sets of the Bem trio as I read in other reviews the sound power was a bit low. I had a terrible experience with this product and I am returning it. The connection is lost only 30' away from the base. Battery doesn't last 6 hrs (maybe 3hrs) The sound quality is awful. 1 speaker wasn't working. It is true that the concept is wonderful  and the design of the Bem is well done. The Bluetooth connection and pairing of multiple sets is easy. There is an echo effect at first but it synchronizes itself quickly later. Too bad the main function of these speakers is not met as advertised: &#34;6hrs at 120' wireless&#34; would have win the event market.,negative

"I purchased this unit to prepare for the hurricane season in Florida. Although I haven’t had a chance to use it during an outage, I have been using it extensively over the past week to test its reliability in keeping the household functioning smoothly. Here’s a detailed account of how I utilized this powerhouse: I set up the Explorer 1000 v2 in a central location within my home for easy access. The first priority was to connect the refrigerator to prevent food spoilage. The 1500W AC output was more than sufficient to keep it running without any hiccups. I also connected a portable air conditioning unit to test it, as outages often happen during particularly hot spells. The power station handled both appliances simultaneously, and I am satisfied with the results. With the power station’s multiple charging ports, I was able to keep all our essential communication devices powered. I used the 100W PD USB-C ports to quickly charge smartphones and a tablet. The fast charging ensured our phones were ready to use much quicker than standard chargers, keeping us connected to family and emergency services. Throughout the testing, I actively used the Jackery app to monitor the power station’s battery level and manage its output. The app allowed me to switch between charging modes depending on our power needs, which may be helpful in prolonging battery life over several hours of an outage. At night, utilizing the quiet mode was beneficial. It significantly reduced the noise level, allowing my family and me to sleep without disturbance while still powering our fridge and a few fans throughout the night. I also have a gas generator at home, and using the Explorer 1000 v2 is a totally different experience. The absence of generator noise makes you forget the fact that you are using backup power. As for the charging speed, Jackery claims a one-hour recharge feature for the Explorer 1000 v2 when the emergency charging mode is activated in the app. While the one-hour recharge is convenient and charges quickly as advertised, it reverts to normal charging mode after each quick charge. So, I just stick with the normal charging mode most of the time. It takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to recharge the 1000 v2 from 0 to 100%, which is good enough for me. Overall, the Explorer 1000 v2 can be trusted as a backup power source during outages. It’s a versatile, powerful tool that will keep our household safe and comfortable.",positive
"To start with, I love my Jackery Explorer 300 and took a chance on the Explorer 1000 and not disappointed. This is copy of my review for DJI Portable Power Station 1000 Vs the Jackery Explorer 1000. I hope to help others when comparing these two popular power stations that are both known for reliability. In the end for a quick read, the Jackery Explorer out performed the DJI Portable Power Station by quite a bit. Great job Jackery! Here is my slightly edited review: I purchased the DJI Power 1,000 Portable Power Station for emegencies as well as camping and such. I do own a Jackery Explorer 300 as well as a Jackery Exporer 1000. Today I tested the Jackery Explorer 1000 (1500W rating) as well as the DJI Power 1000 (2200W rating). I've had the Jackery 1000 for maybe a month and the DJI for about 1 week and both were new up to today and charged to 100% for the first time for this test. I connected each to a 1000W heater (Presto Heat Dish) which is a reflective type heater with no fan/blower, just a heating element reflected off what looks like a satellite dish. I put the heater at highest setting and it was rated at about 1045-1047 watt output according to both battery power stations. I tried to run them both for ONE hour and see what percentage of the battery power stations was left after the hour. The Jackery Exporer 1000 had 40% battery life after 1 one hour which was good, so I first thought. After trying the DJI 1000, the Jackery was apparently very good. The Jackery never really got too warm and was super quiet. The DJI Power 1000 could not make it to one hour. I shut it down after 45 minutes as it only had 7% battery life left. I never run them to zero and 7% was much lower than I like to run them to, but wanted to milk this until at least 45 minutes, which I did. The fan area near the power switch area of the DJI was pretty warm and the other side fan area was cool, near the outlets. The DJI also had noticeable fan noise, but it was just noticeable and not loud. I also noticed after getting the DJI Power 1000 that it didn't have the cigarette lighter receptacle (12V DC) like the Jackery did, which I overlooked. The Jackery is about 2/3 the weight of the DJI and has a swing handle across the top like most smaller power stations do. The DJI had two fixed grips, one on each side which seem more sturdy, but not as convenient to carry around. I don't usually rate and review two named items in a review but both are great names with reliabilty and known quality. I'm just sad to say that the DJI did not live up to my expectations and relly disappointed. Hopefully they will get the battery management taken care of in future models. With the DJI rated another 700 watts than the Jackery, I guess I expected more. If I were to put a 2200 watt device on the DJI Power 1000, I'm not sure it would last a half hour. I would recommend the Jackery Exporer 1000 very easily after my test. jackery is quiet, reliable and the energy used is very well managed within the system.",positive
"This is an amazingly useful gadget! Ours is charged and awaiting the next power outage, but meanwhile it replaces my 2000-watt generator for most jobs. For example: it runs my electric chainsaw just fine. It’s not as heavy as my gas generator, it’s quiet, and totally fuss and drama free!",positive
"Good portable power for many uses. Quick charging, solar panel option. We found that fully charged, it would power two CPAP machines overnight for two nights. Would probably keep your refrigerator running for 18 hours or so, depending on the size of the fridge and whether or not you're opening it much. We also bought the larger size when Amazon had them on sale at the Black Friday event. Highly recommended and Jackery has a great reputation for producing quality portable power devices.",positive
"This was on sale at an amazing price for Black Friday, so I blew my meager budget and bought it. The package arrived yesterday and I opened the box and hooked it up to house power to get it charged up before my Christmas camping trip. As with my 3 other smaller Jackeries, the quality workmanship is evident. The weight is definitely heavy, but not too heavy for me to pick it up and carry it a short distance. Unlike my older Jackeries, the handle on this model folds up to carry and down flat to store. It arrived with 28% charge, so I plugged it in as soon as I had it unboxed. It charged fairly quickly and the display screen tells me the wattage of the charge and it also shows the percent charge. It came with a heavy duty ""Jackery Orange"" AC power cable. I was sad to see that it did NOT come with a cigarette lighter charge cable. And to increase my sadness, I also discovered that it did not come with the solar charge cable; so I had to rush to Amazon and find those items. I had to order two ""7909 to 8020 plugs"" to hook up to my solar charge cables that I already had for my 290w Jackery batteries. Twenty bucks for those; one arriving today the other arriving tomorrow. And I ordered a cigarette lighter charge cable for another 18 dollars that should arrive today. None of those items were Jackery products. I wish Jackery would have included all these accessories with the battery. I'm hoping all the items arrive here in time for my trip. Anyway, I'm a Jackery fan and this is a big, powerful, well made, quality battery. Even without the needed accessories.",positive
"I am an Electronics Engineer and purchased this generator for backup power. This generator is fantastic with a great design ,it is small and not to heavy, has a nice front panel to see charge level, load and input power. I am also a Amateur Radio operator and have used this to power my station in the event of a power outage. My station draws 100- 800 watts depending on transmitted output and it ran this for over 5 hours with 15% charge left. When first received it had a 30% charge and plugged into AC and it charged up in a couple of hours to 100%. I ran an 1800 watt heater and it held the load without any trouble. Of course it would not last to long due to the over rating of the load . I used the 200 watt solar panel to charge the unit and with two partly cloudy days it took about 4- 5 hours each day to be fully charged. with full sun this would be faster. The solar panel works well but you have to move it periodically to maximize solar input and it has a small sight glass to be sure you are aligned with the sun angle. I am very pleased with this generator and will most likely get another so that I will have 400 watts of solar going into the generator (it has two 24volt charge inputs). I did not try charging from my car 12 volt dc . I need to get a cable, though dc chargers are often limited to 10 Amp charge current so the charging could take a while. Overall great unit with versatile charging options( reason I purchased) Have a few of these around and you will have a portable decentralized, quiet power source.",positive
"I bought this portable generator in case of a blackout, so far so good... it is a portable Generator that runs off of solar power. I haven't had a chance to really see how it works. But I have noticed it is a heavy duty, long lasting quality item, that would automatically go to work when pluged in.",positive
"Best purchase I’ve ever made. I’m staying off grid right now in rural New Mexico and this thing is a lifesaver. I purchased a third-party solar panel to go with it because the one made by Jackery is triple the price. So far, after four months, it’s charged just fine with the different panel. My only complaint about this generator is that you have to download an app to use some of its functions. Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of being off-grid where there is likely no cell signal? I don’t know who made that decision but it wasn’t a logical one. Other than that, this thing works like a charm and lasts for nearly a week, as long as I’m using it for things that don’t involve tons of heat.",positive
"I love this thing. It has great flexibility and power. So far I only have 2 small gripes. First, the plugs that jackery uses for solar panels is kind of unique. The solar panels I bought were ""standard"", highly rated, and came with 10 different plug types. None of those plugs worked with the jackery and apparently this is pretty common, having to buy another adapter plug just for jackery devices. So a more common plug standard would be nice. The second gripe is that the AC input power requirements are strict enough that I couldn't charge the jackery with my car using a 300w inverter. The jackery would come to life for about 2 seconds trying to charge, then would stop charging. It would cycle on/off continuously trying to charge from the 300w inverter. It would be nice if the jackery charging circuitry could handle charging from a ""weak"" AC source since available AC power isn't always clean. That's why we have the jackery in the first place! So not being able to charge even slowly from a slightly weak AC source is a big drawback. Other than these gripes however, I am really liking the jackery. Recommended!",positive
"I love how this thing is set up so intuitively. I feel that if I was away from home and the power went out my `non-technical' wife would know how to connect it to the solar panel, aim it at the sun, monitor the input and output wattage on its simple center gauge, and run what appliances/devices she needs. We bought it as a peace of mind. My attention to even considering a solar generator (an overly fancy name for a battery pack) came up while seeing the brand (begins with a ""P"") that heavily runs TV commercials. But, theirs is several hundred dollars more than this Jackery model, and their solar panel generates 100 watts with this one generating 200 watts; and, theirs boasts 1200 watts of functional power wattage, and this Jackery has 1500 watts. The Jackery is also 2 lbs lighter (24 vs. theirs at 26 lbs.). It seems that Jackery incorporated several updates and improvements into this second generation model based on the YouTube reviews I watched. Overall, in my opinion this is a better than average..... solar battery pack. and, I hope to God we never need it, though if my wife and I ever start camping again, now that our kids are on their own, this thing will be central to our packed items.",positive
"I’m not going to go over specs since it’s well known. Just the good and the bad. I took measurements of the AC and DC power outlets and here’s what I found. Pictures show that 2 similarly rated solar panels are charging at 205 watts, which means the built in MPPT charge regulator is working effectively. The AC power is probably better than the quality of your home AC outlets served by your utility company. The sine wave is pretty much perfect without artifacts as seen on my oscilloscope. The frequency is a rock solid 60 Hz with a rock solid 120 volt AC output on most loads. That’s refreshing because some of these so called solar generators put out lower voltage. The DC cigar outlet puts out 13 volts which is adequate, but would have liked to have seen 13.8 volts which would be standard for automotive accessories and radio gear like Ham equipment which likes a solid 13.8 volts in some cases. Fan noise is much better than other brands with similar specs. Probably because they are using a larger fan at lower speeds to cool the inverter power supply. Overall I am very happy with the fit and finish, including the new fold down handle and flat square top. The only complaints I have are as follows: Jackery really skimped out on the USB ports, giving you only one USB A which is ridiculous, and two USB C ports which is just okay. They could have easily doubled that for whatever it costs to make it into a better, more convenient charging station. As I mentioned above, it would have been better to have the DC car charger port put out a more standard 13.8 volts DC. Lastly, it would have been much more practical to include an Anderson Type DC outlet for powering DC equipment at up to 20 Amps instead of the antiquated cigar outlet that can only handle 10 Amps or about 120 watts which is very limited for higher power consumption equipment such as radio equipment, etc. I love the fact that Jackery is finally moving to LiFePO4 battery chemistry which allows for up to 4000 charge cycles (to 70% of original capacity) as per the manufacture specifications. That’s a little optimistic, but it’s much better than some other Lithium ion technology that specifies around 500 cycles. I also love the very fast charging at 1000 watts with a 1200 watt option for super fast charging. The charger is conveniently built in to the unit, so no more power supply bricks to carry around, or worse, to forget at home. The users manual isn’t great, and the “Battery Saver” mode isn’t clearly explained, but it’s a fantastic way to dramatically increase the overall service life of your Jackery by limiting your charge to 85% and limiting discharging to the 15% level. You can change this to get 100% of your battery capacity when needed, but at the expense of overall number of charge cycles. This puts you in control, and is a very welcome and useful feature. I highly recommend this model E1000 V2 by Jackery. It’s all most people will need.",positive
This was a lifesaver as it arrived 3 days before the hurricane and kept my freezer full of steaks going for a few days. Last storm I had to throw hundreds of dollars of food away. It is easy to use and when I put it on sliders it was easy for this old woman to move from place to place with the handle. My only complaint is the price. It went down a couple of days after I purchased it and Amazon could not give me a rebate and neither would Jackery. I ended up buying a second one for $100 less a couple of months later so I would have a longer safety net for the next storm. The price variations are the biggest downfall and would be behoove those wanting to buy to keep track and buy accordingly. I picked this brand because of all the live in your van and tiny home videos I watch on YouTube. You have to top it off every 3 months but so far mine have remained at 100% capacity. I hope I seldom or never need to use them. That would not be wasted money but a sort of insurance. The winter I bought a new coat and boots it did not snow and I was tempted to do the same the next year. Cheaper than heat bills.,negative
"Many of you are probably like me having a tough time deciding between Delta 2 or Explorer 1000v2. The 2 are almost identical in all aspects. Both Ecoflow and Jackery are good brands, and you can expect good build quality and reliability. Seems that the Explorer is always priced at $50 below the Delta 2. At the end, I picked the Explorer. The rationale was simple. I could not find any justification to spend $50 more for the Delta 2. On Black Friday, net price for Explorer was $349, which was a no brainer. For reference I paid $400 for the Ecoflow River 2 Pro 8 months ago. I use these power stations primarily during power outage. If you run them 24/7, your buying decision may be different. Expandability is not a factor for me (the add-on batteries are never cheap anyway), nor is solar charging. I deploy the power stations distributively wherever power is needed, rather than building them into a centralized power source. Here are the main differences between the Explorer and the Delta 2 that I considered. - The Explorer is $50 cheaper ($349 vs $399 on Black Friday) - The Explorer has a good LED lamp which is handy during power outage. - The Explorer has bigger capacity (1070Wh vs 1024) - The Explorer is 3 lbs lighter. To me, anything over 25lb is only marginally portable. - The Explorer does lack 12vdc barrel plug ports which Ecoflow has. Those ports can be used to power modems. But I already have other power stations that have those ports. - The solar port on the Explorer not as common as that on the Delta 2. - The ac sockets are upfront on Explorer while in the back for Delta. I prefer them to be upfront. I see absolutely no advantage of them being in the back, except maybe it looks neater to have the cables in the back if you have a semi-permanent installation. Definitely better to have them upfront for emergency use. On charging. When I first got my Explorer, it was 80% charged. And it seemed stuck at a very slow charging rate of about 300W. Installing the mobile app and selecting the ""emergency boost mode"" made no difference while selecting the slower quiet mode actually made it charge faster. I thought I had a defective unit for sure. But after draining the battery, the battery then charged between 600 to 800W most of the time at the default fast mode until near the top-off stage. Hitting the boost mode did take it up to 1000W level. Even quiet mode got over 300W. I am convinced that the unit can be fully charged using the default fast mode in well under 2 hours, and that is good enough for me. Even at the default fast mode, it was much quieter than my Ecoflow River 2 pro. The quiet mode does bring down the noise to an unobtrusive level. The inverter on the Explorer seems excellent. The ac output was very steady at 120V, never dropping below 119V on 100W draw.",negative
"Wondering about the actual wattage of the solar panels? Verified 200w! I live in New England and figured I'd only get 200w out in the desert at mid day. I just put them in my backyard, not even properly aligned, and got 193w input to the battery. Charged from 93% to 100% in about half an hour. This was the biggest concern I had because solar is so environmentally dependent. The battery itself is fantastic. The USB-C 100w is perfect for my laptop without having to convert through the AC. 3 AC outlets is plenty for me. Lots of info on the battery itself and through the app. Well designed and well made. Very happy.",positive
"I can unironically attest that the Jackery Explorer 1000 V2 is a game changer because I am not confined to a household outlet when I have an outdoor project. I can use my 10-gallon shop vac and carpet spot cleaner to clean my car anywhere. I have a Mora fridge with a 22.3 Cu. Ft. bottom freezer, and the Jackery can keep it powered for 18 hours. The runtime goes down to about 8-10 hours when I plug in the fridge and my 7.0 Cu. Ft. Insignia Chest Freezer at the same time. I have also used it to run my office set up, which includes an internet router, lamp, monitor, and laptop for 12-14 hours. I got this when it went on sale on Black Friday 2024 for $450 (before tax), and bought a second one (04.09.25) when it went on sale again for the same price. After researching competitors, no other solar generator can offer you the same capacity and runtime at $450. But if this thing goes back to the regular price? Then you should explore other options. The Jackery Explorer V2 is as big as a large insulated lunchbox and weighs 20 lbs., so it is easy to travel with for outdoor adventures.",negative
"I now have a Jackery 300, 500 and 1000 v.2. I rec'd the 1000 v.2 today. It shipped with 28% power, and I was surprised to see that it came with a direct plug-in power cord (no brick). It took about 75 minutes to charge it, with the input wattage scaling from 300 to 600 watts. After it was fully charged I tested it with our full-size kitchen fridge. When plugged in it initially drew about 250 watts (compressor start?) then settled it at 60 watts per hour. It estimated it would run around 13 hours. When the door was opened and the light came on it spiked to 72 watts. This what I was looking for, something easy to charge and store but that would get us over a 24-48 hour power outage. I'm too old to start my gas generator but this is easily manageable. It does have 2 DC power ports that would take 2 solar panels. All in all, the Jackery family works for me in a number of applications. One solar panel works with all 3.",negative
"Original review below this. Jackery customer support did get a new unit back to me, arguably later than they advertised, however they did outreach to me about my experience, which I appreciate. I have these ordered under a separate account for work, the smaller units for inspectors and they have worked flawlessly to keep laptops and starlink powered in remote areas. I'm going to chalk up the delayed customer service based upon the holidays. When you put out thousands upon thousands of these products, it's not unusual to have a certain percentage fail for various reasons. Jackery is the premier provider of this type product, so part of the purchase is customer service knowing they are going to be around if something goes wrong with your unit. Personally I was unlucky on this particular unit as it died after 6 months for no reason I wasn't even using it. But with that said these things happen and so long as they are backing the warranty all good. All the other units that we purchased for work, they are all going strong. And my older jackery 500 still working great. The main reason I have these is for resiliency especially around wildfires, and power outages in Northern California. While I have a couple of inverter generators that will run 8 hours on a gallon of gas, they are a pain to take out during a three or four hour outage. The products offered by jackery can be a great tool in combination with regular generators. You can bring them inside your house and not worry about carbon monoxide poisoning or anything else. Original review I’ve been a loyal customer of Jackery for years, but my recent experience with the Jackery 1000 V2 and their customer service has left me extremely disappointed. The unit failed within six months with an error fault. I contacted customer service on November 19th, returned the unit before Thanksgiving, and was assured that a replacement would be shipped within two business days. It is now December 6th, and despite numerous follow-ups, I’ve only received vague responses that they are ""looking into it."" This is particularly disheartening given my history with Jackery. My first purchase, a Jackery 500, failed within a week of use about four years ago, but their customer service back then was outstanding. They promptly replaced the unit, which has worked flawlessly ever since. I’ve also purchased several units for work based on my prior positive experiences. I understand that occasional product failures happen—that’s not my issue. What I take issue with is the clear decline in both product reliability and customer service. Jackery's customer service was once a defining feature of the brand, but that no longer seems to be the case. If you’re considering a Jackery product, I recommend looking into alternative brands. While they were once a standout, my recent experience suggests their quality and service have significantly degraded.",negative
"Battery charges fast and worked well. The app has some issues. It won't reliably reconnect to the battery with Bluetooth. The app will not allow me to connect the battery to my WiFi, because the app won't allow spaces in WiFi passwords. Edit: Jackery reached out to help make sure my battery is operating properly. They clarified that the Bluetooth is only active on the battery when it's powered on. I'll be keeping an eye on it to make sure it's staying connected like it's supposed to. They submitted a bug report internally for the app, as it's only an issue right now with the Android version. Hopefully this will be getting fixed soon. I appreciate and admire their support of their product. Thank you Brian!",positive
"The intuitive and very easy to use phone app should be a model for all hardware apps. The app keeps track of input and output wattage. It allows setting of many parameters including charging rate, auto-off time and emergency charging. The emergency charging mode allows for quick charging in anticipation of an incipient power outage. I have purchased 3 Jackery Explorer 1000's. Hardware is very solid and has a quality feel.",negative
We loved it so much we bought two! Need to be hurricane ready so we wanted to add to our current gas generator. Bought the Jackery and tested it out. Charged fast. Ran our fridge for 7 hours! We also bought the solar panels with our second Jackery. Tried them out and they charged it in just a few hours! We are ready (but hopefully never need them) lol. This company is fantastic to work with!,positive
The Jackery 1000 v2.0 is one of the most awesome products I have ever purchased. After testing it out I feel so much better having one. I'm going to use it for power outages so I can run an IcyBreeze cooler and watch Netflix on my laptop. This is a huge improvement for me since last year's hurricane season.,positive
"The Jackery came but no solar panels. If the solar panel comes still the rating will change. Fast forward... the solar panels came. I had to look at it again because it looks like the stretchy legs are on the front, but from all the videos I've looked at, it's supposed to be that way.",positive
"Quality-built backup battery for power outages. Also great for outside work, saving the hassle with long extension cords. Not to forget the excellent customer service.",positive
This is one of 2 units I bought that are Jackery and works great the 2nd unit is defective and I can’t get it returned keep getting the run around I wanted to buy another one of these units but won’t now if this is how trying to return a defective one is so beware!! I wish I could say better I don’t like leaving bad reviews and I really wanted to buy another unit but not now,negative
"At this point, I have to begin my review from the start, again. The Jackery Explorer 1000v2 is a great looking power station (not a ""generator"" as written on the outer box) which sports multiple 110VAC outlets with a 1500 watt rating, multiple USB 5V options, and a 6V car accessory type outlet. It has two charge inputs which allow up to 400W of charging ability. The battery capacity is 1070Wh though that needs to be taken with reservation since there are several losses not included that can reduce this figure somewhat. The unit is well built with a swing up carrying handle, the Jackery black and orange color scheme, and a squarish profile with rounded corners and edges. It weighs in at 24 pounds or 10.8kg. Included are a 110VAC charging cable (which is the fastest way to charge the unit) and a user manual. Now for my ""cons"". When I tried to load the ""Jackery"" app on my Motorola (Moto g Pure) phone, all the Google Play store would show was a ""Jackery Home"" app. That isn't the correct app (which I found out after loading it and not being able to use it). My phone failed to show the correct app which is the ""Jackery"" app. After finding it with a separate search, I found that my phone wouldn't accept it (I later discovered this is a fault of my phone). I had several discussions with Jackery which didn't lead to anything. I then tried my tablet and it brought up and loaded the ""Jackery"" app with no issues and that is the way I'll have to handle my Bluetooth and WiFi which is ok but I'd rather my phone was capable of that (minus points for Motorola). The thing I was really impressed with was a technician from Jackery had read my comments here and with Jackery support, and called me back and tried to help me get the app working with my phone. Most companies would not have taken that much effort. Kudos to Jackery. One thing missing that probably should have been included with the Jackery Explorer is a solar charge cable and dust caps for the outlets. I will be doing some solar charging and it would have been nice not to have to buy the solar charge cable separately. A nice 6V outlet dust cap came with my smaller Jackery but this one just has the bare outlet which can collect debris pretty easily. This was no big issue since I 3D printed a dust plug which works fine (and I purchased some 110VAC safety plugs for the 110VAC outlets which I painted Jackery orange to match the unit color scheme). All considered, this is a great mid-size power station utilizing Lithium Iron Phosphate cells, which provides a safer, longer lasting power source compared to Lithium Polymer based stations. It's charge capacity and 110VAC output can run lights for a long time, and many common appliances for less time. Heavy loads (my air compressor and vacuum cleaner with power head) are not supported which wasn't too surprising.",negative
"I've had the Explorer 880 (which is essentially a V1 1000 with less watt hours) for a couple of years and while it has performed dutifully during that time and was a literal life saver, it had limitations that I think the 1000 V2 addresses: 1. The V2 inverter outputs 120V instead of the 110V of the V1. It may not matter much for electronics that have their own power supplies but I think it did make a difference for motors and compressors that run just a little more sluggishly. If a house's power is below 114V, it's considered too low by the NEC too. 2. The V2 has 1500 watt sustained output vs. 1000W that the old version had but more importantly, It can go as high as 3000 watts for startup which is absolutely amazing for things like fridges or other devices that have a inrush current. I remember trying a 10 LPM Oxygen concentrator for a now dearly departed family member and the old one would really struggle to start up. Same for fridges. The V2 just doesn't care. 3. The LIFEPO4 battery means a lot more charge cycles so this thing should last a long time...I mean truthfully, plain old Lithium ion should be good for most people too and I've only probably had 6 complete discharge/charge cycles on mine but if you use this for your primary source of power, then it would really matter. 4. This is very simplified with just a power cord and no power brick required. You don't need to remember to take all the attachments with you. I do wish however that they gave the adapter for 8080 DC port so you can use your old car charger instead of buying a new one but you should be able to find on on here for $10. Overall I'm happy with the purchase and wish I had gotten a 2nd one for Black Friday",positive
Takes 6 hours to charge now they have gens that take 1 hour to charge,negative
Jackery customer service heard about the issue and resolved it. I must change my review to Jackery actually listens and cares about their customers. Says alot since most companies just don't care. Very impressed,negative
"Update: recently reviewed this as not working. I receive connector adaptors from the manufacturer and it now works. I have yet to test it to see if it will handle 1500 watts, that's why I'm saving the last star. I will update this review once I've confirmed that it can handle 1500 watts or close to that number.",negative
I love my two Jackery’s. They are there when you need them. Charges last long. Not bad for recharging. I never let mine get below half. Charging panels are nice. Weight isn’t too bad. They seem to be quality built. I have a very big Dometic refrigerator/freezer for my vehicle and it runs 24/7. I switch them out daily. I love the size of them too. My first one the handle doesn’t fold down so I appreciate that on the new one.,positive
"Update: Jackery customer service promptly reached out to me and provided quick easy reset instructions. My 1000v2 fully charged to 100% and is working flawlessly! Thank you for the prompt attention!! I now have three Jackery units (1000, 300, and 240) and I highly recommend each unit. Received the Jackery 1000. After reading the instructions I checked the unit, it was charged at 28% so I plugged it into to recharge. After charging for 3 hours, it is stuck at 46% (with 0% input indicator). Yes, the outlet works fine. There’s nothing in the instructions addressing this issue so I’m assuming it’s defective. I have not tried the solar panel as it is currently cloudy/raining. Really disappointed since this is my 2nd Jackery purchase. My previous purchase (Jackery 240) was flawless and still works great.",negative
"I have purchased two of these products for our family. A smaller one for camping and traveling and a larger one for emergencies. In fact, we used our larger one in January when the winds caused electrical outage. It kept the refrigerator running all night. We are saving to buy an even larger one for the freezer. Excellent product!",positive
Works great! The same as my other 3 Jackery's. I trust this brand so I buy only this brand products!,positive
"I love all the Jackrey products. I own several of them. Very versatile when the power goes out to have more than one. I can put one on the freezer, and set up most of the house on an 1800 W unit. And I have a 3000 W Unit that I use is my backup to recharge these if solar doesn’t work. But if the sun is shining the solar works really well. I got this one on an amazing black Friday deal. It’s very nice. If I had known how nice it was, and that it was the updated 1000 W unit I would’ve bought several of them. Unfortunately, that was a one time deal and they’re quite a bit more expensive now.",positive
"This one is a lot better than the one they made before because they handle lays flat. I put the previous one on top. Also, it has Bluetooth so you can turn it on with your phone. If you're in a place where you need to have power because there are blackouts this is the one to have.. I can run my TV with my Internet, which is connected to another backup powder supply for a day.",negative
Used this for fourteen days straight recently on a cart to power different electronic gear on a cart in a hospital and it performed perfectly. I used both the 110v AC USB-C plugs constant draw for 12 or so hours each day and plugged it in each night to re-charge. A great purchase (especially at a discount for cyber Monday).,positive
Outstanding,negative
"I got this power station to run my fridge in the event of a power outage. For reference, my fridge is a cheap, basic GE model that uses about 130 watts while the compressor is running, spikes to 430 watts during startup, and averages 65 watts over the course of a day. This Jackery can run my fridge for a bit over 12 hours, which is about what I expected if you assume the inverter is 80% efficient. I'm sure if I was using a more efficient chest freezer I'd get a lot longer runtime, but that's nothing the generator can control. The jackery does its job well & handles all of the load spikes that come with the compressor spinning up every so often, though admittedly 430 watt peaks are nowhere near the rated 1500w max for this thing. I have a few other (smaller) Jackery power stations, and I've also tested a few other off-brand power stations too. This one has the same sort of quality you can expect from Jackery, and I definitely recommend going with them over some of the other no-name brands. You can pretty much always expect Jackery to meet or exceed it's rated specs, while you can't say the same for some of the cheaper brands... Also, as an aside, their support is great! I missed a promo by buying at the wrong time, and even though Amazon said they couldn't do anything, Jackery's support was able to take care of me. They are definitely my go-to power station brand and I highly recommend them.",positive
"Fairly nice power bank with decent output. One thing I didn't like is that if you apply power to charge, it turns on and doesn't seem to turn off automatically even with zero load. I waited several hours and it was still on draining the battery. It would be nice to plug it into a smart power plug so I can have it charge every month or two, but that's going to be a pain. The cheap monoprice one I got doesn't have this problem.",negative
"Really nice product, good quality build. Saw the price dropped by $50 one week after I bought it. Kindly requested a price adjustment, which they granted within a couple business days.",positive
"Works great! Totally silent, can use indoors because it does not generate carbon monoxide. Thrilled to not have to use that noisy gas generator anymore",positive
Generator is nice but I had to charge it up inside my house using wall socket . I was not aware that the adapter needed to be removed . Great Product. I will upgrade soon!!! Thank You Jackery Team.,positive
"I like the look and portability. Also, the interface is very easy to use and gives all the pertinent information. The displayed values for time left to charge and to discharge are relatively accurate. But it will be limited as a back-up in a power outage. I tested 3 of my appliances. The freezer at a steady 115W lasted 8.5 hours The refrigerator ranged from 0 to 138W and lasted about 11 hours. The time left to charge varied with the variable wattage used. The space heater, on the medium setting, used 916W and lasted 1 hour. The solar charging gained 1% of charge in about 6 hours of PNW sunshine, so not helpful.",negative
Love this Jackery. My apologies to to the manufacturer for writing a negative review on the app. I downloaded the wrong one and could not connect to the device but after I got the right app. Everything was perfect. After charging it to 100% I ran my Nespresso machine which uses about 1350 watts and the Jachery performance was flawless. Now I am a happy camper with the jackery and the Nespresso machine.,positive
Bluetooth worked upon startup w my iPhone however within a few hours it stopped connecting. Couldn’t get it to hook back up. Will call customer support I figured out Bluetooth. Working proper,negative
"I bought this 40lb battery because I found it on sale and I've been wanting to get one for a while. I'm a little concerned that the winter storm moving through might take out the heat in a day or two and I'll really get a chance to test this thing out, but I'm sure it will be okay because this is big enough to run a small heater for a little while. Or power the mini fridge for some meds. Or run the c-pap. We're so dependent on electricity, we don't even think of what we lose if the grid goes down. It just feels like a more important investment day by day. So far, it works great. It charges quickly from the wall. I haven't tried it with my solar panel yet. It's not a Jackery brand panel, so I hope that's not a problem, but I don't think it should be. I'll be waiting until it's warmer to try that, unless the power does go out! If that happens in a few days, I'll let you know how that goes!",negative
"The power goes out in my neighborhood more often than I'd like. I decided to buy this Jackery backup battery to keep my fridge running, for the most part. Since I bought it the power stopped going out so I appreciated the power of the Jackery right there. But yesterday the power went out for hours and I used it as I had planned. When I first started using it it was charged to 93% then throughout the day I ran my large refrigerator for 4 hours, charged my iPad, charged an auxillary battery and made some toast in the toaster and by the time the lights came back on the battery was at 43%. Oh and I used the flashlight while I was in the kitchen. I was really hoping that it would keep my frozen foods frozen and it did so much more than that.",negative

"The Jackery Explorer 1000 is a versatile and powerful portable power station that’s perfect for camping trips, outdoor adventures, or even as an emergency backup power source. It can power a variety of devices, including laptops, mini-fridges, CPAP machines, and more. The 1000W pure sine wave inverter provides a stable power output, making it safe for sensitive electronics. The build quality is solid, with a robust and durable design. The LCD screen is a nice touch, providing real-time information about remaining battery life, input/output wattage, and charging status.",positive
We lose power at our home about 5 x a year. Usually out from 5-24 hours. The Jackery has been a valuable item to have charged and ready. Got 2! Highly recommend critical review:,negative
"I barely got three uses out of the Explorer 1000 before it completely broke down despite all efforts with troubleshooting. I had purchased the 1000 model on 2020. It is now 2024. It was mainly for power outages at home and periodic outdoor trips. For comparison, I had also previously purchased 300 and 500 models and both continue to work very well despite having been purchased earlier. Jackery support team went through the typical support responses (eg. “Power stations are like car batteries and you should….” etc etc and “try resetting” etc and they could not give further support). To be fair, it was just one year beyond the warranty period so “that’s their policy on these matters”. Sigh. What I have learned: Their products are attractive and generally work well. Their products are popular. But Jackery’s product support is typical product support. Other company’s product support have gone above and beyond. Was hoping for additional information on alternatives to revive the power station (try sending to third party to repair etc etc) After all, I had only used it three times and paying $990 for it! Wonder if others have had slightly better support during the warranty period? Oh well…… Updated review 06 Feb 25: After this review, I was contacted by phone and email about the issue. Kudos to them for that. Jackery said that I could send it to them with postage paid by them and they will re-evaluate it for repair and if possible fix it for a price. Sounds reasonable. Later Jackery indicated I need to pay for postage as well! Obviously, the cost of paying the postage, AND the repair (if fixable) was not worth it. Additionally, I was on vacation during the communications and Jackery seemed to be in a rush and keen to close the ticket. Pluses and minuses here; I’d say that their products are generally good but Jackery’s support, in my case , if needed, is like pulling teeth. I like to support a company with both good products AND customer support. I’ll try Anker or Ecoflow next.",positive
Product seems fine at least after just a week of ownership but this connector issue why do we have to have special connectors and junk up our drawer with all these different connections very disappointed… make one kind of connector and stick to it for charging your battery from a solar panel…. it’s proprietary that does no one any good So unless you wanna search search search for special connectors that fit your Jackery look elsewhere,negative
"Just received my Jackery. While I haven't actually used it out in the wild yet I'm already highly disappointed. The box was sealed, but after taking the unit out I saw several scuffs on the top and front of the unit. One mark in front is deep and bad. So apparently they're repackaging returns and selling them as new. Not cool. I charged it to 50% right away, and the charging speed from my wall outlet was steadily and consistently about 240-245 watts. It never even hit 250 watts. The bluetooth kept disconnecting even though I was only about five feet away from the unit with my phone. I have no interest in or use for using wifi, but there's no way to disable it. Not that big of a deal, but the flashing icon is a bit annoying, and means it's constantly working to find a connection and connect. Not sure if this is a lemon (someone returned it after all) or if they're all like this, but it's definitely not what I was expecting. I already have an older 240 from a few years ago, and have had no issues with it. Unfortunately I lost the wall charger for that and only have the car charger. The wall charger from the 1000 v2 doesn't work with the 240, and the car charger from the 240 doesn't work with the 1000 v2. Overall quite frustrating and disappointing. UPDATE: the icing on the cake is that Jackery reached out to me two days after I posted this review and offered to make it right for me. I accepted their offer the same day, and now three days later they messaged me back, backtracking from the offer they extended to me, and is saying they're going to have a customer service representative contact me shortly. What? So my experience which was negative just became exponentially more negative based on their handling of a formerly satisfied and now dissatisfied customer.",negative
The unit had potential for size and power but the solar option which is what most of us buy these products for is lacking. There are two ports for solar but its not clear which is one takes the larger amount of power or if its split in half and both combined allow for the 400w input. Also the cable you need or adapter is specific to Jackery and isn't a universal port you can just connect your normal solar cables for. The unit powered most things but NOT MY DRYER which doesn't even surge to 1600watt. the unit doesn't even attempt to start my dryer it just cuts off. For small appliances like coffee makers or fridges yeah it works but use case is limited and not universal. ALSO I could not get this to charge fast even with the app settings.,positive
Good product but should come with storage bags for the money instead of buying separate,positive
"Well, it can't even run a 200 Watt heater for more than 4 hours, a vacuum took it down to50 percent charge quickly. I'm disappointed about that, Because I wanted to use it in my small cabin out by the lake, so for that I don't think it's worth the $800. They're asking for it. It does charge up pretty quickly. Maybe within 8 or 9 hours. It's fully charged again, but it's not as useful as I thought it would be period I think if you're just using it to power a laptop or a few other accessories charging phones but to run appliances. Maybe a small coffee Maker a couple times but really it's not all that I'm not real happy with it, over priced for the limitations and not nearly as advertised.",negative
It took me a long time to figure out that the proper connection between the solar panels and the generator is the straight connector and not the right angle one. Nowhere in the instructions was this made clear and only after watching on line video reviews of the product did I realize why I could not make the solar panels generate input into the generator.,negative
"I bought this to run lights for my booth at craft shows. After reading and watching hundreds of positive reviews, I thought I had found the perfect answer to my prayers! I did the math to be sure it would be able to supply the right amount of power that I needed, so I was super excited to give it a try. The first day I used it, it only lasted 5 hours and 50 minutes. Most of my shows are a minimum of 8 hours a day. When I found out that I wasn't allowed to return it, I was highly disappointed that I had wasted my money.",negative
"Though it looks EXACTLY the same as other models, the input is very slightly different. My Jackery 300 takes a 7.9mm input, this takes an 8mm input. The 7.9 will fit but doesn't charge. Why not just make them all the same? You have to read VERY deep into the literature to find this info. Other than that, works great and has a built in solar charger so you can plug panels directly into it (not through their own controller if they have one).",positive
"I think Jackery makes a good product and that the design is well thought out. That being said, their product support desperately needs to be improved. I live in the Houston area and bought this product as part of my emergency preparedness setup. I tested it and was happy that it met my expectations. Then Hurricane Beryl hit, we were without power or cell phone service for nine days, and the AC outlets would not work. The display gave a fault code, but the instructions do not include a comprehensive list of fault codes. So I had no way to troubleshoot on my own. I had to drive out of the area to reach a place where I could get cell phone service, but their customer service does not have extended hours. When I finally did reach them, there was an astounding lack of urgency to resolve the problem. Each call was met with the reply that the appropriate team would get back to me within 48 hours. That was not acceptable! The item needed to be replaced, but they would not send the replacement until the defective item was received. Also not acceptable. There was way too much back and forth to resolve the issue, and their messages sometimes did not take into account information that was previously provided. It was a very frustrating experience, and I wound up converting my exchange into a return. It took a full 30 days of constant follow-up to receive my refund. Also not acceptable. The bottom line? Inadequate documentation and inept customer support.",negative
"For the money you pay, it would be nice to get a cover over the Is cigarette lighter plug in. Also a bag n chargers with other ways of charging it. Like with the other brands n sizes.",negative
"This is my 3rd Jackery unit I have purchased. I still have another older, 1000 W Jackery. Using the same amount of power, the old Jackery lasts nearly 3 times longer then this new one. While the new one charges way, way faster… it doesn’t last long.",positive
Unfortunately these jackery 1000s don't work with diesel heaters which really bummed me out as I was in a 20 degree tent then found out.... as my 500 worked great but got stolen from my truck. Unfortunately a return for me now as thats one of my biggest reasons in wanting the Jackery. The heater gives a E02 error code which means its giving too much power to the heater. After going over all specs and everything that shouldnt of been an issue but sure is. Be careful getting this if using a diesel heater,positive
"I really believed it would last at least for couple days, but it doesn't even last for a whole day, the only thing i connect is my laptop and it holds 6-8 hours max, what a waste...",negative
"BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS! I will say the battery came promptly and appears to do what it is supposed to do. Thankfully, haven't needed to use it, yet. The reason for warning is this DOES NOT come with solar panels. The description says ""solar powered"" and I even remember seeing a statement that the panels come separately. When I contacted Jackery, via Amazon, I was told the order I purchased didn't come bundled with the panels. There is NOTHING on the Amazon add that says the panels are not included. If you want to purchase the combination, you have to order directly from Jackery.",negative
"Jackery charges a premium with their units than the competition. I bought their unit just because their perceived brand reputation thinking this may be safer and of better quality. I was completely wrong. The UPS function is not working properly likely due to a firmware bug. If the battery is charged 100% then it won't switch back to AC unless battery level is dropped to 99%. This can take very long if the battery is under light load and may be a hazard due to the voltage difference to the wall with other appliances. On inverter mode, the neutral also has voltage and the ground seems disconnected. This has caused my downstream appliances and surge protectors to report warning/faults. The Inverter has also damaged my computer PSU. I connected two computers, one turned on fine but the other started seriously vibrating. It was extremely loud and scary. The PSU seems to be permanently damaged. After this incident, every time on boot up it vibrates a bit. This is not acceptable and I had to return this item. The good part of the customer support experience are that seller provided shipment label. Also it accepted my price matching request within a week (before I found out all the problems and requested the return). But they never refunded me after receiving the return and has been falsely claiming that the refunding had been issued when questioned, though in reality even the Amazon customer service could not find the refund. I had to file a claim through Amazon to get my money back. To summarize, Jackery failed to perform proper QA to ensure proper functionality, used design/components that can cause damage, and their customer support, though prompt in response, gaslights and provides false information when issues occur.",negative
"It used to be with a jackery product that you could simply plug whatever into it and it would just work. Outputs and inputs were all very flexible and they always worked. Now these next gen LifePO4 batteries are riddled with all kinds of glitches and temperamental behaviors. For example right now my battery shows 80% left and I want to top it off. I plug in the 12v cigarette adapter and it starts charging at 100 watts. Sounds good right? Nope, because after 5 seconds the battery reduced the charge input to 6 just watts which is terrible. Not a faulty plug or cord either. It’s jackery’s own cord. Ok, so I’ll use my inverter to charge it with 120v. Oh wait, can’t do that because my inverter is rated for 750 watts and the way this battery is designed it needs the full 1500 watt household rating just for it to recognize that input. Another terrible design. This thing can charge control to any wattage but it will only recognize one input wattage for 120v. So you basically can’t charge this from you RV’s inverter. Forcing someone to control certain features via the app is the final poor decision that lead me to return this. If they are going to force feed you to the app then make an app that actually works. The Bluetooth connection required drops or times out and it requires a complete new pairing to get connected again. Couldn’t return this fast enough. Last Chinese jackery product for me.",negative
200w panel will give about 125W full sun. If you are lucky it will peak at 150W. The supplied cable likely reduces the power wattage. The 200w rating is likely theoretical direct at the combined cells without any external connectors or cables.,negative
"Items come at different times, but you only get information on partial. Confusing as to whether everything will come together. Had to reach out to get additional information. It worked out, but confusing.",negative
"***2 month update*** dependability ZERO, shuts off when it wants to, it has begun needing the reboot commands to get it operational again, absolute waste of money. ***original*** While it comes with a power cord for charging from a wall outlet, the seller separately only provides one DC connector for attaching a solar panel. However, there are two available input ports, and without this connector, the other port is essentially useless. The app that is supposed to pair with the unit rarely connects, and on my first trip, it completely stopped working. To make matters worse, the power button no longer turns off the unit, and every time it reaches a full 100% charge, it powers off once disconnected from the 120V power source which is annoying when you are not expecting the power to go out and reset your electronics (using it for video and satellite communications). Additionally, there's no straightforward way to charge the unit from a 12V DC source out of the box. This requires purchasing additional accessories, which is disappointing. Overall, I’ve encountered multiple frustrations with the unit, especially considering the cost.",negative
"I recently bought a Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 solar generator that will charge just fine when plugged into 120 volts but will not charge from either of the two solar panels I have. I have a Dokio 200 watt solar panel that works perfectly and I use to charge my 12 Volt lead acid batteries using the charge controller. I plugged the Dokio and controller into my Jackery. It wouldn't charge. I plugged just the solar panel into my Jackery and even though the panels were putting out 14.9 volts the Jackery wouldn't charge. I called Jackery support and after a day or two got a call back and talked to a young lady with a thick accent who obviously knew nothing about electricity and simply told me to buy a jackery solar panel. I looked on Amazon for a Jackery solar panel but they were twice the price of everyone else's. I found a Grecell 200 watt solar panel that guaranteed compatibility with Jackery and ordered it. I plugged it into the jackery solar generator when it arrived but once again, the Jackery would not charge. I called jackery support again yesterday and I'm still waiting for a callback. I'm just about done with Jackery and my next call will either make or break whether I send the solar generator back for a refund. Stay tuned!",positive
"This is my sixth Jackery solar generator. Each iteration presents different standards for utilizing power and solar charging. This has always been disconcerting to me. When I set up this unit I plugged in a portable Jackery solar panel and could not make it work. I called Jackery—they explained that I needed an adapter, which they did not provide with the unit, furthermore they could not sell me an adapter because it was out of stock. Jackery is so greedy that they make their new products incompatible with their earlier products then leave the consumer solving a problem Jackery created and profits further from the solution. It feels like dealing with Apple. Note to Jackery, you are not Apple.",negative
"Would not even power a light duty electric stapler on full charge. Good for lights and charging power tool batteries, and that's about it",positive
"Honestly, after having this item almost a month, I still don't know how well it works. It needs a proprietary connector to work with any solar panel but a Jackery brand. We ordered it (an additional $20) but we're not pleased, and may still return it.",negative
"Unit was dead on arrival. Granted, Jackery offered to replace it, but I had already shipped it out of the US and could not ship it back. Thus, no replacement without sending the old unit back. Understandable, but be warned, these things have a reputation for being dead when they get to you (I am not the first to experience this problem).",negative
"Overpriced and unreliable. Multiple times throughout the night, it stays on but cuts power output. I would buy another brand. Very disappointed. Will be returning. review 77： The item arrived today it was on sale for a package deal for the inverter and a solar panel photo includes my order receipt at a specially reduced price. The item arrived without the solar panel. The worst part is I had already ordered another unit that was refurbished back in June unfortunately it didn't work and I returned it I am still waiting for the refund from jackery I now have paid $900 for this combo and about another $500 for the other one I returned that I'm still waiting for the refund on and now I'm waiting for the other part and no word from jackery that it is on its way or acknowledging the problem at all",negative
This thing just almost caught my house on fire. The cord which was never used before today just caught on fire. I am livid! Decided to charge it in the house instead of with the solar panels and it caught fire. Bad cord! They sent my refund to he wrong place and did not credit my Amazon account as promised so I got nothing back. Do not buy from this company. I will not remove this unless they correct this issue.,negative
This power station used battery power much more rapidly than it should and also was unable to run some items that were within the specs for wattage. Had to return it.,negative
The Jackery Explorer appears to function OK. But the 200 W Solar panels are not putting out any wattage at all according to the Explorer. Nor are they charging the unit. Returning this.,negative
Don't buy this. It's non-returnable. Absolutely not useable for tent camping. Stay with Coleman and ice. Turns out to be a very expensive mistake!,negative
"Jackery Explorer 10000v2 did not work with my solar panels. After weeks of trying, they eventually took the unit back and refunded my money. To compensate for my hassles, they sent me a free Jackery 100.",negative
"I ordered the 1000 v2 and solar panels. They shipped as two separate packages. The generator arrived on time. According to Amazon and the shipper the panels arrived today. But they didn't. We'll see what Jackery does to resolve this. This is generally a commentary on Jackery itself. For a quality company, they do seem to have issues with customer service, as in this case. As that is part of the whole experience, it seems like something they should pay better attention to. Once I get the panels I will review the package, but until they're here, that's a bit hard to do.",negative
I got a 1500 watt generator. I use it to power a portable heater. I use it on low. And it periodically turns on and off on its own. The heater uses about 1300 watts. The battery only last 3 hours at most. If you are going to use this during long power outages think again. Please think of finding another generator.,negative

From this company at your own risk. Robert did not work and I had an almost impossible getting my money back. Avoid unless you just like headaches.,negative
Item defective. Inverter portion wasn’t working. Asked to return. Given erroneous return instructions. Shipper would not accept due to the battery. Bad product and bad return instructions.,negative

"Ordered mine directly from Jackery. Brand new out of the box had a 29% battery. I immediately plugged it in to get a full charge and it quoted me another 4.6 hours of charging. That’s funny, it specifically states a ‘full charge in 1.7 hours’ on all their literature…..",negative
Love this jackery. It is extremely quiet. My only complaint is that the car charging cable from my previous jackerys does not work for this one. This is disappointing because this is why I’ve stayed with the same line.,positive
Disappointed in power. I had purchased to have an electric backup for my koi pond pump. Lost power a couple of weeks ago and it was not able to provide enough power to run my pump.,negative
"VERY UPSET that I received a USED generator. I paid the price for new and received something used. It works so far with the minimal testing I did, but I’m hoping it doesn’t show signs of whatever reason it whatever reason it was returned for.",negative
"Love it, have my internet and home security running off of it so I can check on the house even when the power goes out. You have to buy a separate plug to hook up your own solar panels if you want to so something custom but I'm happy with this purchase and using it as a UPS when not using it for camping, charging my drone batteries, running a tv in a field, etc.",positive
