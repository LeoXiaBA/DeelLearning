review1,"I purchased this unit to prepare for the hurricane season in Florida. Although I haven’t had a chance to use it during an outage, I have been using it extensively over the past week to test its reliability in keeping the household functioning smoothly. Here’s a detailed account of how I utilized this powerhouse: I set up the Explorer 1000 v2 in a central location within my home for easy access. The first priority was to connect the refrigerator to prevent food spoilage. The 1500W AC output was more than sufficient to keep it running without any hiccups. I also connected a portable air conditioning unit to test it, as outages often happen during particularly hot spells. The power station handled both appliances simultaneously, and I am satisfied with the results. With the power station’s multiple charging ports, I was able to keep all our essential communication devices powered. I used the 100W PD USB-C ports to quickly charge smartphones and a tablet. The fast charging ensured our phones were ready to use much quicker than standard chargers, keeping us connected to family and emergency services. Throughout the testing, I actively used the Jackery app to monitor the power station’s battery level and manage its output. The app allowed me to switch between charging modes depending on our power needs, which may be helpful in prolonging battery life over several hours of an outage. At night, utilizing the quiet mode was beneficial. It significantly reduced the noise level, allowing my family and me to sleep without disturbance while still powering our fridge and a few fans throughout the night. I also have a gas generator at home, and using the Explorer 1000 v2 is a totally different experience. The absence of generator noise makes you forget the fact that you are using backup power. As for the charging speed, Jackery claims a one-hour recharge feature for the Explorer 1000 v2 when the emergency charging mode is activated in the app. While the one-hour recharge is convenient and charges quickly as advertised, it reverts to normal charging mode after each quick charge. So, I just stick with the normal charging mode most of the time. It takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to recharge the 1000 v2 from 0 to 100%, which is good enough for me. Overall, the Explorer 1000 v2 can be trusted as a backup power source during outages. It’s a versatile, powerful tool that will keep our household safe and comfortable."
review2,"To start with, I love my Jackery Explorer 300 and took a chance on the Explorer 1000 and not disappointed. This is copy of my review for DJI Portable Power Station 1000 Vs the Jackery Explorer 1000. I hope to help others when comparing these two popular power stations that are both known for reliability. In the end for a quick read, the Jackery Explorer out performed the DJI Portable Power Station by quite a bit. Great job Jackery! Here is my slightly edited review: I purchased the DJI Power 1,000 Portable Power Station for emegencies as well as camping and such. I do own a Jackery Explorer 300 as well as a Jackery Exporer 1000. Today I tested the Jackery Explorer 1000 (1500W rating) as well as the DJI Power 1000 (2200W rating). I've had the Jackery 1000 for maybe a month and the DJI for about 1 week and both were new up to today and charged to 100% for the first time for this test. I connected each to a 1000W heater (Presto Heat Dish) which is a reflective type heater with no fan/blower, just a heating element reflected off what looks like a satellite dish. I put the heater at highest setting and it was rated at about 1045-1047 watt output according to both battery power stations. I tried to run them both for ONE hour and see what percentage of the battery power stations was left after the hour. The Jackery Exporer 1000 had 40% battery life after 1 one hour which was good, so I first thought. After trying the DJI 1000, the Jackery was apparently very good. The Jackery never really got too warm and was super quiet. The DJI Power 1000 could not make it to one hour. I shut it down after 45 minutes as it only had 7% battery life left. I never run them to zero and 7% was much lower than I like to run them to, but wanted to milk this until at least 45 minutes, which I did. The fan area near the power switch area of the DJI was pretty warm and the other side fan area was cool, near the outlets. The DJI also had noticeable fan noise, but it was just noticeable and not loud. I also noticed after getting the DJI Power 1000 that it didn't have the cigarette lighter receptacle (12V DC) like the Jackery did, which I overlooked. The Jackery is about 2/3 the weight of the DJI and has a swing handle across the top like most smaller power stations do. The DJI had two fixed grips, one on each side which seem more sturdy, but not as convenient to carry around. I don't usually rate and review two named items in a review but both are great names with reliabilty and known quality. I'm just sad to say that the DJI did not live up to my expectations and relly disappointed. Hopefully they will get the battery management taken care of in future models. With the DJI rated another 700 watts than the Jackery, I guess I expected more. If I were to put a 2200 watt device on the DJI Power 1000, I'm not sure it would last a half hour. I would recommend the Jackery Exporer 1000 very easily after my test. jackery is quiet, reliable and the energy used is very well managed within the system."
review3,"This is an amazingly useful gadget! Ours is charged and awaiting the next power outage, but meanwhile it replaces my 2000-watt generator for most jobs. For example: it runs my electric chainsaw just fine. It’s not as heavy as my gas generator, it’s quiet, and totally fuss and drama free!"
review4,"Good portable power for many uses. Quick charging, solar panel option. We found that fully charged, it would power two CPAP machines overnight for two nights. Would probably keep your refrigerator running for 18 hours or so, depending on the size of the fridge and whether or not you're opening it much. We also bought the larger size when Amazon had them on sale at the Black Friday event. Highly recommended and Jackery has a great reputation for producing quality portable power devices."
review5,"This was on sale at an amazing price for Black Friday, so I blew my meager budget and bought it. The package arrived yesterday and I opened the box and hooked it up to house power to get it charged up before my Christmas camping trip. As with my 3 other smaller Jackeries, the quality workmanship is evident. The weight is definitely heavy, but not too heavy for me to pick it up and carry it a short distance. Unlike my older Jackeries, the handle on this model folds up to carry and down flat to store. It arrived with 28% charge, so I plugged it in as soon as I had it unboxed. It charged fairly quickly and the display screen tells me the wattage of the charge and it also shows the percent charge. It came with a heavy duty ""Jackery Orange"" AC power cable. I was sad to see that it did NOT come with a cigarette lighter charge cable. And to increase my sadness, I also discovered that it did not come with the solar charge cable; so I had to rush to Amazon and find those items. I had to order two ""7909 to 8020 plugs"" to hook up to my solar charge cables that I already had for my 290w Jackery batteries. Twenty bucks for those; one arriving today the other arriving tomorrow. And I ordered a cigarette lighter charge cable for another 18 dollars that should arrive today. None of those items were Jackery products. I wish Jackery would have included all these accessories with the battery. I'm hoping all the items arrive here in time for my trip. Anyway, I'm a Jackery fan and this is a big, powerful, well made, quality battery. Even without the needed accessories."
review6,"I am an Electronics Engineer and purchased this generator for backup power. This generator is fantastic with a great design ,it is small and not to heavy, has a nice front panel to see charge level, load and input power. I am also a Amateur Radio operator and have used this to power my station in the event of a power outage. My station draws 100- 800 watts depending on transmitted output and it ran this for over 5 hours with 15% charge left. When first received it had a 30% charge and plugged into AC and it charged up in a couple of hours to 100%. I ran an 1800 watt heater and it held the load without any trouble. Of course it would not last to long due to the over rating of the load . I used the 200 watt solar panel to charge the unit and with two partly cloudy days it took about 4- 5 hours each day to be fully charged. with full sun this would be faster. The solar panel works well but you have to move it periodically to maximize solar input and it has a small sight glass to be sure you are aligned with the sun angle. I am very pleased with this generator and will most likely get another so that I will have 400 watts of solar going into the generator (it has two 24volt charge inputs). I did not try charging from my car 12 volt dc . I need to get a cable, though dc chargers are often limited to 10 Amp charge current so the charging could take a while. Overall great unit with versatile charging options( reason I purchased) Have a few of these around and you will have a portable decentralized, quiet power source."
review7,"I bought this portable generator in case of a blackout, so far so good... it is a portable Generator that runs off of solar power. I haven't had a chance to really see how it works. But I have noticed it is a heavy duty, long lasting quality item, that would automatically go to work when pluged in."
review8,"Best purchase I’ve ever made. I’m staying off grid right now in rural New Mexico and this thing is a lifesaver. I purchased a third-party solar panel to go with it because the one made by Jackery is triple the price. So far, after four months, it’s charged just fine with the different panel. My only complaint about this generator is that you have to download an app to use some of its functions. Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of being off-grid where there is likely no cell signal? I don’t know who made that decision but it wasn’t a logical one. Other than that, this thing works like a charm and lasts for nearly a week, as long as I’m using it for things that don’t involve tons of heat."
review9,"I love this thing. It has great flexibility and power. So far I only have 2 small gripes. First, the plugs that jackery uses for solar panels is kind of unique. The solar panels I bought were ""standard"", highly rated, and came with 10 different plug types. None of those plugs worked with the jackery and apparently this is pretty common, having to buy another adapter plug just for jackery devices. So a more common plug standard would be nice. The second gripe is that the AC input power requirements are strict enough that I couldn't charge the jackery with my car using a 300w inverter. The jackery would come to life for about 2 seconds trying to charge, then would stop charging. It would cycle on/off continuously trying to charge from the 300w inverter. It would be nice if the jackery charging circuitry could handle charging from a ""weak"" AC source since available AC power isn't always clean. That's why we have the jackery in the first place! So not being able to charge even slowly from a slightly weak AC source is a big drawback. Other than these gripes however, I am really liking the jackery. Recommended!"
review10,"I love how this thing is set up so intuitively. I feel that if I was away from home and the power went out my `non-technical' wife would know how to connect it to the solar panel, aim it at the sun, monitor the input and output wattage on its simple center gauge, and run what appliances/devices she needs. We bought it as a peace of mind. My attention to even considering a solar generator (an overly fancy name for a battery pack) came up while seeing the brand (begins with a ""P"") that heavily runs TV commercials. But, theirs is several hundred dollars more than this Jackery model, and their solar panel generates 100 watts with this one generating 200 watts; and, theirs boasts 1200 watts of functional power wattage, and this Jackery has 1500 watts. The Jackery is also 2 lbs lighter (24 vs. theirs at 26 lbs.). It seems that Jackery incorporated several updates and improvements into this second generation model based on the YouTube reviews I watched. Overall, in my opinion this is a better than average..... solar battery pack. and, I hope to God we never need it, though if my wife and I ever start camping again, now that our kids are on their own, this thing will be central to our packed items."
review11,"I’m not going to go over specs since it’s well known. Just the good and the bad. I took measurements of the AC and DC power outlets and here’s what I found. Pictures show that 2 similarly rated solar panels are charging at 205 watts, which means the built in MPPT charge regulator is working effectively. The AC power is probably better than the quality of your home AC outlets served by your utility company. The sine wave is pretty much perfect without artifacts as seen on my oscilloscope. The frequency is a rock solid 60 Hz with a rock solid 120 volt AC output on most loads. That’s refreshing because some of these so called solar generators put out lower voltage. The DC cigar outlet puts out 13 volts which is adequate, but would have liked to have seen 13.8 volts which would be standard for automotive accessories and radio gear like Ham equipment which likes a solid 13.8 volts in some cases. Fan noise is much better than other brands with similar specs. Probably because they are using a larger fan at lower speeds to cool the inverter power supply. Overall I am very happy with the fit and finish, including the new fold down handle and flat square top. The only complaints I have are as follows: Jackery really skimped out on the USB ports, giving you only one USB A which is ridiculous, and two USB C ports which is just okay. They could have easily doubled that for whatever it costs to make it into a better, more convenient charging station. As I mentioned above, it would have been better to have the DC car charger port put out a more standard 13.8 volts DC. Lastly, it would have been much more practical to include an Anderson Type DC outlet for powering DC equipment at up to 20 Amps instead of the antiquated cigar outlet that can only handle 10 Amps or about 120 watts which is very limited for higher power consumption equipment such as radio equipment, etc. I love the fact that Jackery is finally moving to LiFePO4 battery chemistry which allows for up to 4000 charge cycles (to 70% of original capacity) as per the manufacture specifications. That’s a little optimistic, but it’s much better than some other Lithium ion technology that specifies around 500 cycles. I also love the very fast charging at 1000 watts with a 1200 watt option for super fast charging. The charger is conveniently built in to the unit, so no more power supply bricks to carry around, or worse, to forget at home. The users manual isn’t great, and the “Battery Saver” mode isn’t clearly explained, but it’s a fantastic way to dramatically increase the overall service life of your Jackery by limiting your charge to 85% and limiting discharging to the 15% level. You can change this to get 100% of your battery capacity when needed, but at the expense of overall number of charge cycles. This puts you in control, and is a very welcome and useful feature. I highly recommend this model E1000 V2 by Jackery. It’s all most people will need."
review12,This was a lifesaver as it arrived 3 days before the hurricane and kept my freezer full of steaks going for a few days. Last storm I had to throw hundreds of dollars of food away. It is easy to use and when I put it on sliders it was easy for this old woman to move from place to place with the handle. My only complaint is the price. It went down a couple of days after I purchased it and Amazon could not give me a rebate and neither would Jackery. I ended up buying a second one for $100 less a couple of months later so I would have a longer safety net for the next storm. The price variations are the biggest downfall and would be behoove those wanting to buy to keep track and buy accordingly. I picked this brand because of all the live in your van and tiny home videos I watch on YouTube. You have to top it off every 3 months but so far mine have remained at 100% capacity. I hope I seldom or never need to use them. That would not be wasted money but a sort of insurance. The winter I bought a new coat and boots it did not snow and I was tempted to do the same the next year. Cheaper than heat bills.
review13,"Many of you are probably like me having a tough time deciding between Delta 2 or Explorer 1000v2. The 2 are almost identical in all aspects. Both Ecoflow and Jackery are good brands, and you can expect good build quality and reliability. Seems that the Explorer is always priced at $50 below the Delta 2. At the end, I picked the Explorer. The rationale was simple. I could not find any justification to spend $50 more for the Delta 2. On Black Friday, net price for Explorer was $349, which was a no brainer. For reference I paid $400 for the Ecoflow River 2 Pro 8 months ago. I use these power stations primarily during power outage. If you run them 24/7, your buying decision may be different. Expandability is not a factor for me (the add-on batteries are never cheap anyway), nor is solar charging. I deploy the power stations distributively wherever power is needed, rather than building them into a centralized power source. Here are the main differences between the Explorer and the Delta 2 that I considered. - The Explorer is $50 cheaper ($349 vs $399 on Black Friday) - The Explorer has a good LED lamp which is handy during power outage. - The Explorer has bigger capacity (1070Wh vs 1024) - The Explorer is 3 lbs lighter. To me, anything over 25lb is only marginally portable. - The Explorer does lack 12vdc barrel plug ports which Ecoflow has. Those ports can be used to power modems. But I already have other power stations that have those ports. - The solar port on the Explorer not as common as that on the Delta 2. - The ac sockets are upfront on Explorer while in the back for Delta. I prefer them to be upfront. I see absolutely no advantage of them being in the back, except maybe it looks neater to have the cables in the back if you have a semi-permanent installation. Definitely better to have them upfront for emergency use. On charging. When I first got my Explorer, it was 80% charged. And it seemed stuck at a very slow charging rate of about 300W. Installing the mobile app and selecting the ""emergency boost mode"" made no difference while selecting the slower quiet mode actually made it charge faster. I thought I had a defective unit for sure. But after draining the battery, the battery then charged between 600 to 800W most of the time at the default fast mode until near the top-off stage. Hitting the boost mode did take it up to 1000W level. Even quiet mode got over 300W. I am convinced that the unit can be fully charged using the default fast mode in well under 2 hours, and that is good enough for me. Even at the default fast mode, it was much quieter than my Ecoflow River 2 pro. The quiet mode does bring down the noise to an unobtrusive level. The inverter on the Explorer seems excellent. The ac output was very steady at 120V, never dropping below 119V on 100W draw."
review14,"Wondering about the actual wattage of the solar panels? Verified 200w! I live in New England and figured I'd only get 200w out in the desert at mid day. I just put them in my backyard, not even properly aligned, and got 193w input to the battery. Charged from 93% to 100% in about half an hour. This was the biggest concern I had because solar is so environmentally dependent. The battery itself is fantastic. The USB-C 100w is perfect for my laptop without having to convert through the AC. 3 AC outlets is plenty for me. Lots of info on the battery itself and through the app. Well designed and well made. Very happy."
review15,"I can unironically attest that the Jackery Explorer 1000 V2 is a game changer because I am not confined to a household outlet when I have an outdoor project. I can use my 10-gallon shop vac and carpet spot cleaner to clean my car anywhere. I have a Mora fridge with a 22.3 Cu. Ft. bottom freezer, and the Jackery can keep it powered for 18 hours. The runtime goes down to about 8-10 hours when I plug in the fridge and my 7.0 Cu. Ft. Insignia Chest Freezer at the same time. I have also used it to run my office set up, which includes an internet router, lamp, monitor, and laptop for 12-14 hours. I got this when it went on sale on Black Friday 2024 for $450 (before tax), and bought a second one (04.09.25) when it went on sale again for the same price. After researching competitors, no other solar generator can offer you the same capacity and runtime at $450. But if this thing goes back to the regular price? Then you should explore other options. The Jackery Explorer V2 is as big as a large insulated lunchbox and weighs 20 lbs., so it is easy to travel with for outdoor adventures."
review16,"I now have a Jackery 300, 500 and 1000 v.2. I rec'd the 1000 v.2 today. It shipped with 28% power, and I was surprised to see that it came with a direct plug-in power cord (no brick). It took about 75 minutes to charge it, with the input wattage scaling from 300 to 600 watts. After it was fully charged I tested it with our full-size kitchen fridge. When plugged in it initially drew about 250 watts (compressor start?) then settled it at 60 watts per hour. It estimated it would run around 13 hours. When the door was opened and the light came on it spiked to 72 watts. This what I was looking for, something easy to charge and store but that would get us over a 24-48 hour power outage. I'm too old to start my gas generator but this is easily manageable. It does have 2 DC power ports that would take 2 solar panels. All in all, the Jackery family works for me in a number of applications. One solar panel works with all 3."
review17,"Original review below this. Jackery customer support did get a new unit back to me, arguably later than they advertised, however they did outreach to me about my experience, which I appreciate. I have these ordered under a separate account for work, the smaller units for inspectors and they have worked flawlessly to keep laptops and starlink powered in remote areas. I'm going to chalk up the delayed customer service based upon the holidays. When you put out thousands upon thousands of these products, it's not unusual to have a certain percentage fail for various reasons. Jackery is the premier provider of this type product, so part of the purchase is customer service knowing they are going to be around if something goes wrong with your unit. Personally I was unlucky on this particular unit as it died after 6 months for no reason I wasn't even using it. But with that said these things happen and so long as they are backing the warranty all good. All the other units that we purchased for work, they are all going strong. And my older jackery 500 still working great. The main reason I have these is for resiliency especially around wildfires, and power outages in Northern California. While I have a couple of inverter generators that will run 8 hours on a gallon of gas, they are a pain to take out during a three or four hour outage. The products offered by jackery can be a great tool in combination with regular generators. You can bring them inside your house and not worry about carbon monoxide poisoning or anything else. Original review I’ve been a loyal customer of Jackery for years, but my recent experience with the Jackery 1000 V2 and their customer service has left me extremely disappointed. The unit failed within six months with an error fault. I contacted customer service on November 19th, returned the unit before Thanksgiving, and was assured that a replacement would be shipped within two business days. It is now December 6th, and despite numerous follow-ups, I’ve only received vague responses that they are ""looking into it."" This is particularly disheartening given my history with Jackery. My first purchase, a Jackery 500, failed within a week of use about four years ago, but their customer service back then was outstanding. They promptly replaced the unit, which has worked flawlessly ever since. I’ve also purchased several units for work based on my prior positive experiences. I understand that occasional product failures happen—that’s not my issue. What I take issue with is the clear decline in both product reliability and customer service. Jackery's customer service was once a defining feature of the brand, but that no longer seems to be the case. If you’re considering a Jackery product, I recommend looking into alternative brands. While they were once a standout, my recent experience suggests their quality and service have significantly degraded."
review18,"Battery charges fast and worked well. The app has some issues. It won't reliably reconnect to the battery with Bluetooth. The app will not allow me to connect the battery to my WiFi, because the app won't allow spaces in WiFi passwords. Edit: Jackery reached out to help make sure my battery is operating properly. They clarified that the Bluetooth is only active on the battery when it's powered on. I'll be keeping an eye on it to make sure it's staying connected like it's supposed to. They submitted a bug report internally for the app, as it's only an issue right now with the Android version. Hopefully this will be getting fixed soon. I appreciate and admire their support of their product. Thank you Brian!"
review19,"The intuitive and very easy to use phone app should be a model for all hardware apps. The app keeps track of input and output wattage. It allows setting of many parameters including charging rate, auto-off time and emergency charging. The emergency charging mode allows for quick charging in anticipation of an incipient power outage. I have purchased 3 Jackery Explorer 1000's. Hardware is very solid and has a quality feel."
review20,We loved it so much we bought two! Need to be hurricane ready so we wanted to add to our current gas generator. Bought the Jackery and tested it out. Charged fast. Ran our fridge for 7 hours! We also bought the solar panels with our second Jackery. Tried them out and they charged it in just a few hours! We are ready (but hopefully never need them) lol. This company is fantastic to work with!
review21,The Jackery 1000 v2.0 is one of the most awesome products I have ever purchased. After testing it out I feel so much better having one. I'm going to use it for power outages so I can run an IcyBreeze cooler and watch Netflix on my laptop. This is a huge improvement for me since last year's hurricane season.
review22,"The Jackery came but no solar panels. If the solar panel comes still the rating will change. Fast forward... the solar panels came. I had to look at it again because it looks like the stretchy legs are on the front, but from all the videos I've looked at, it's supposed to be that way."
review23,"Quality-built backup battery for power outages. Also great for outside work, saving the hassle with long extension cords. Not to forget the excellent customer service."
review24,This is one of 2 units I bought that are Jackery and works great the 2nd unit is defective and I can’t get it returned keep getting the run around I wanted to buy another one of these units but won’t now if this is how trying to return a defective one is so beware!! I wish I could say better I don’t like leaving bad reviews and I really wanted to buy another unit but not now
review25,"At this point, I have to begin my review from the start, again. The Jackery Explorer 1000v2 is a great looking power station (not a ""generator"" as written on the outer box) which sports multiple 110VAC outlets with a 1500 watt rating, multiple USB 5V options, and a 6V car accessory type outlet. It has two charge inputs which allow up to 400W of charging ability. The battery capacity is 1070Wh though that needs to be taken with reservation since there are several losses not included that can reduce this figure somewhat. The unit is well built with a swing up carrying handle, the Jackery black and orange color scheme, and a squarish profile with rounded corners and edges. It weighs in at 24 pounds or 10.8kg. Included are a 110VAC charging cable (which is the fastest way to charge the unit) and a user manual. Now for my ""cons"". When I tried to load the ""Jackery"" app on my Motorola (Moto g Pure) phone, all the Google Play store would show was a ""Jackery Home"" app. That isn't the correct app (which I found out after loading it and not being able to use it). My phone failed to show the correct app which is the ""Jackery"" app. After finding it with a separate search, I found that my phone wouldn't accept it (I later discovered this is a fault of my phone). I had several discussions with Jackery which didn't lead to anything. I then tried my tablet and it brought up and loaded the ""Jackery"" app with no issues and that is the way I'll have to handle my Bluetooth and WiFi which is ok but I'd rather my phone was capable of that (minus points for Motorola). The thing I was really impressed with was a technician from Jackery had read my comments here and with Jackery support, and called me back and tried to help me get the app working with my phone. Most companies would not have taken that much effort. Kudos to Jackery. One thing missing that probably should have been included with the Jackery Explorer is a solar charge cable and dust caps for the outlets. I will be doing some solar charging and it would have been nice not to have to buy the solar charge cable separately. A nice 6V outlet dust cap came with my smaller Jackery but this one just has the bare outlet which can collect debris pretty easily. This was no big issue since I 3D printed a dust plug which works fine (and I purchased some 110VAC safety plugs for the 110VAC outlets which I painted Jackery orange to match the unit color scheme). All considered, this is a great mid-size power station utilizing Lithium Iron Phosphate cells, which provides a safer, longer lasting power source compared to Lithium Polymer based stations. It's charge capacity and 110VAC output can run lights for a long time, and many common appliances for less time. Heavy loads (my air compressor and vacuum cleaner with power head) are not supported which wasn't too surprising."
review26,"I've had the Explorer 880 (which is essentially a V1 1000 with less watt hours) for a couple of years and while it has performed dutifully during that time and was a literal life saver, it had limitations that I think the 1000 V2 addresses: 1. The V2 inverter outputs 120V instead of the 110V of the V1. It may not matter much for electronics that have their own power supplies but I think it did make a difference for motors and compressors that run just a little more sluggishly. If a house's power is below 114V, it's considered too low by the NEC too. 2. The V2 has 1500 watt sustained output vs. 1000W that the old version had but more importantly, It can go as high as 3000 watts for startup which is absolutely amazing for things like fridges or other devices that have a inrush current. I remember trying a 10 LPM Oxygen concentrator for a now dearly departed family member and the old one would really struggle to start up. Same for fridges. The V2 just doesn't care. 3. The LIFEPO4 battery means a lot more charge cycles so this thing should last a long time...I mean truthfully, plain old Lithium ion should be good for most people too and I've only probably had 6 complete discharge/charge cycles on mine but if you use this for your primary source of power, then it would really matter. 4. This is very simplified with just a power cord and no power brick required. You don't need to remember to take all the attachments with you. I do wish however that they gave the adapter for 8080 DC port so you can use your old car charger instead of buying a new one but you should be able to find on on here for $10. Overall I'm happy with the purchase and wish I had gotten a 2nd one for Black Friday"
review27,Takes 6 hours to charge now they have gens that take 1 hour to charge
review28,Jackery customer service heard about the issue and resolved it. I must change my review to Jackery actually listens and cares about their customers. Says alot since most companies just don't care. Very impressed
review29,"Update: recently reviewed this as not working. I receive connector adaptors from the manufacturer and it now works. I have yet to test it to see if it will handle 1500 watts, that's why I'm saving the last star. I will update this review once I've confirmed that it can handle 1500 watts or close to that number."
review30,I love my two Jackery’s. They are there when you need them. Charges last long. Not bad for recharging. I never let mine get below half. Charging panels are nice. Weight isn’t too bad. They seem to be quality built. I have a very big Dometic refrigerator/freezer for my vehicle and it runs 24/7. I switch them out daily. I love the size of them too. My first one the handle doesn’t fold down so I appreciate that on the new one.
review31,"Update: Jackery customer service promptly reached out to me and provided quick easy reset instructions. My 1000v2 fully charged to 100% and is working flawlessly! Thank you for the prompt attention!! I now have three Jackery units (1000, 300, and 240) and I highly recommend each unit. Received the Jackery 1000. After reading the instructions I checked the unit, it was charged at 28% so I plugged it into to recharge. After charging for 3 hours, it is stuck at 46% (with 0% input indicator). Yes, the outlet works fine. There’s nothing in the instructions addressing this issue so I’m assuming it’s defective. I have not tried the solar panel as it is currently cloudy/raining. Really disappointed since this is my 2nd Jackery purchase. My previous purchase (Jackery 240) was flawless and still works great."
review32,"I have purchased two of these products for our family. A smaller one for camping and traveling and a larger one for emergencies. In fact, we used our larger one in January when the winds caused electrical outage. It kept the refrigerator running all night. We are saving to buy an even larger one for the freezer. Excellent product!"
review33,Works great! The same as my other 3 Jackery's. I trust this brand so I buy only this brand products!
review34,"I love all the Jackrey products. I own several of them. Very versatile when the power goes out to have more than one. I can put one on the freezer, and set up most of the house on an 1800 W unit. And I have a 3000 W Unit that I use is my backup to recharge these if solar doesn’t work. But if the sun is shining the solar works really well. I got this one on an amazing black Friday deal. It’s very nice. If I had known how nice it was, and that it was the updated 1000 W unit I would’ve bought several of them. Unfortunately, that was a one time deal and they’re quite a bit more expensive now."
review35,"This one is a lot better than the one they made before because they handle lays flat. I put the previous one on top. Also, it has Bluetooth so you can turn it on with your phone. If you're in a place where you need to have power because there are blackouts this is the one to have.. I can run my TV with my Internet, which is connected to another backup powder supply for a day."
review36,Used this for fourteen days straight recently on a cart to power different electronic gear on a cart in a hospital and it performed perfectly. I used both the 110v AC USB-C plugs constant draw for 12 or so hours each day and plugged it in each night to re-charge. A great purchase (especially at a discount for cyber Monday).
review37,Outstanding
review38,"I got this power station to run my fridge in the event of a power outage. For reference, my fridge is a cheap, basic GE model that uses about 130 watts while the compressor is running, spikes to 430 watts during startup, and averages 65 watts over the course of a day. This Jackery can run my fridge for a bit over 12 hours, which is about what I expected if you assume the inverter is 80% efficient. I'm sure if I was using a more efficient chest freezer I'd get a lot longer runtime, but that's nothing the generator can control. The jackery does its job well & handles all of the load spikes that come with the compressor spinning up every so often, though admittedly 430 watt peaks are nowhere near the rated 1500w max for this thing. I have a few other (smaller) Jackery power stations, and I've also tested a few other off-brand power stations too. This one has the same sort of quality you can expect from Jackery, and I definitely recommend going with them over some of the other no-name brands. You can pretty much always expect Jackery to meet or exceed it's rated specs, while you can't say the same for some of the cheaper brands... Also, as an aside, their support is great! I missed a promo by buying at the wrong time, and even though Amazon said they couldn't do anything, Jackery's support was able to take care of me. They are definitely my go-to power station brand and I highly recommend them."
review39,"Fairly nice power bank with decent output. One thing I didn't like is that if you apply power to charge, it turns on and doesn't seem to turn off automatically even with zero load. I waited several hours and it was still on draining the battery. It would be nice to plug it into a smart power plug so I can have it charge every month or two, but that's going to be a pain. The cheap monoprice one I got doesn't have this problem."
review40,"Really nice product, good quality build. Saw the price dropped by $50 one week after I bought it. Kindly requested a price adjustment, which they granted within a couple business days."
review41,"Works great! Totally silent, can use indoors because it does not generate carbon monoxide. Thrilled to not have to use that noisy gas generator anymore"
review42,Generator is nice but I had to charge it up inside my house using wall socket . I was not aware that the adapter needed to be removed . Great Product. I will upgrade soon!!! Thank You Jackery Team.
review43,"I like the look and portability. Also, the interface is very easy to use and gives all the pertinent information. The displayed values for time left to charge and to discharge are relatively accurate. But it will be limited as a back-up in a power outage. I tested 3 of my appliances. The freezer at a steady 115W lasted 8.5 hours The refrigerator ranged from 0 to 138W and lasted about 11 hours. The time left to charge varied with the variable wattage used. The space heater, on the medium setting, used 916W and lasted 1 hour. The solar charging gained 1% of charge in about 6 hours of PNW sunshine, so not helpful."
review44,Love this Jackery. My apologies to to the manufacturer for writing a negative review on the app. I downloaded the wrong one and could not connect to the device but after I got the right app. Everything was perfect. After charging it to 100% I ran my Nespresso machine which uses about 1350 watts and the Jachery performance was flawless. Now I am a happy camper with the jackery and the Nespresso machine.
review45,Bluetooth worked upon startup w my iPhone however within a few hours it stopped connecting. Couldn’t get it to hook back up. Will call customer support I figured out Bluetooth. Working proper
review46,"I bought this 40lb battery because I found it on sale and I've been wanting to get one for a while. I'm a little concerned that the winter storm moving through might take out the heat in a day or two and I'll really get a chance to test this thing out, but I'm sure it will be okay because this is big enough to run a small heater for a little while. Or power the mini fridge for some meds. Or run the c-pap. We're so dependent on electricity, we don't even think of what we lose if the grid goes down. It just feels like a more important investment day by day. So far, it works great. It charges quickly from the wall. I haven't tried it with my solar panel yet. It's not a Jackery brand panel, so I hope that's not a problem, but I don't think it should be. I'll be waiting until it's warmer to try that, unless the power does go out! If that happens in a few days, I'll let you know how that goes!"
review47,"The power goes out in my neighborhood more often than I'd like. I decided to buy this Jackery backup battery to keep my fridge running, for the most part. Since I bought it the power stopped going out so I appreciated the power of the Jackery right there. But yesterday the power went out for hours and I used it as I had planned. When I first started using it it was charged to 93% then throughout the day I ran my large refrigerator for 4 hours, charged my iPad, charged an auxillary battery and made some toast in the toaster and by the time the lights came back on the battery was at 43%. Oh and I used the flashlight while I was in the kitchen. I was really hoping that it would keep my frozen foods frozen and it did so much more than that."
review48,I had an issue and customer service took care of it.Great customer service and a great product.I highly recommend!
review49,"The Jackery Explorer 1000 is a versatile and powerful portable power station that’s perfect for camping trips, outdoor adventures, or even as an emergency backup power source. It can power a variety of devices, including laptops, mini-fridges, CPAP machines, and more. The 1000W pure sine wave inverter provides a stable power output, making it safe for sensitive electronics. The build quality is solid, with a robust and durable design. The LCD screen is a nice touch, providing real-time information about remaining battery life, input/output wattage, and charging status."
review50,We lose power at our home about 5 x a year. Usually out from 5-24 hours. The Jackery has been a valuable item to have charged and ready. Got 2! Highly recommend critical review:
review51,"I barely got three uses out of the Explorer 1000 before it completely broke down despite all efforts with troubleshooting. I had purchased the 1000 model on 2020. It is now 2024. It was mainly for power outages at home and periodic outdoor trips. For comparison, I had also previously purchased 300 and 500 models and both continue to work very well despite having been purchased earlier. Jackery support team went through the typical support responses (eg. “Power stations are like car batteries and you should….” etc etc and “try resetting” etc and they could not give further support). To be fair, it was just one year beyond the warranty period so “that’s their policy on these matters”. Sigh. What I have learned: Their products are attractive and generally work well. Their products are popular. But Jackery’s product support is typical product support. Other company’s product support have gone above and beyond. Was hoping for additional information on alternatives to revive the power station (try sending to third party to repair etc etc) After all, I had only used it three times and paying $990 for it! Wonder if others have had slightly better support during the warranty period? Oh well…… Updated review 06 Feb 25: After this review, I was contacted by phone and email about the issue. Kudos to them for that. Jackery said that I could send it to them with postage paid by them and they will re-evaluate it for repair and if possible fix it for a price. Sounds reasonable. Later Jackery indicated I need to pay for postage as well! Obviously, the cost of paying the postage, AND the repair (if fixable) was not worth it. Additionally, I was on vacation during the communications and Jackery seemed to be in a rush and keen to close the ticket. Pluses and minuses here; I’d say that their products are generally good but Jackery’s support, in my case , if needed, is like pulling teeth. I like to support a company with both good products AND customer support. I’ll try Anker or Ecoflow next."
review52,Product seems fine at least after just a week of ownership but this connector issue why do we have to have special connectors and junk up our drawer with all these different connections very disappointed… make one kind of connector and stick to it for charging your battery from a solar panel…. it’s proprietary that does no one any good So unless you wanna search search search for special connectors that fit your Jackery look elsewhere
review53:,"Just received my Jackery. While I haven't actually used it out in the wild yet I'm already highly disappointed. The box was sealed, but after taking the unit out I saw several scuffs on the top and front of the unit. One mark in front is deep and bad. So apparently they're repackaging returns and selling them as new. Not cool. I charged it to 50% right away, and the charging speed from my wall outlet was steadily and consistently about 240-245 watts. It never even hit 250 watts. The bluetooth kept disconnecting even though I was only about five feet away from the unit with my phone. I have no interest in or use for using wifi, but there's no way to disable it. Not that big of a deal, but the flashing icon is a bit annoying, and means it's constantly working to find a connection and connect. Not sure if this is a lemon (someone returned it after all) or if they're all like this, but it's definitely not what I was expecting. I already have an older 240 from a few years ago, and have had no issues with it. Unfortunately I lost the wall charger for that and only have the car charger. The wall charger from the 1000 v2 doesn't work with the 240, and the car charger from the 240 doesn't work with the 1000 v2. Overall quite frustrating and disappointing. UPDATE: the icing on the cake is that Jackery reached out to me two days after I posted this review and offered to make it right for me. I accepted their offer the same day, and now three days later they messaged me back, backtracking from the offer they extended to me, and is saying they're going to have a customer service representative contact me shortly. What? So my experience which was negative just became exponentially more negative based on their handling of a formerly satisfied and now dissatisfied customer."
review54:,The unit had potential for size and power but the solar option which is what most of us buy these products for is lacking. There are two ports for solar but its not clear which is one takes the larger amount of power or if its split in half and both combined allow for the 400w input. Also the cable you need or adapter is specific to Jackery and isn't a universal port you can just connect your normal solar cables for. The unit powered most things but NOT MY DRYER which doesn't even surge to 1600watt. the unit doesn't even attempt to start my dryer it just cuts off. For small appliances like coffee makers or fridges yeah it works but use case is limited and not universal. ALSO I could not get this to charge fast even with the app settings.
review55:,Good product but should come with storage bags for the money instead of buying separate
review56:,"Well, it can't even run a 200 Watt heater for more than 4 hours, a vacuum took it down to50 percent charge quickly. I'm disappointed about that, Because I wanted to use it in my small cabin out by the lake, so for that I don't think it's worth the $800. They're asking for it. It does charge up pretty quickly. Maybe within 8 or 9 hours. It's fully charged again, but it's not as useful as I thought it would be period I think if you're just using it to power a laptop or a few other accessories charging phones but to run appliances. Maybe a small coffee Maker a couple times but really it's not all that I'm not real happy with it, over priced for the limitations and not nearly as advertised."
review57:,It took me a long time to figure out that the proper connection between the solar panels and the generator is the straight connector and not the right angle one. Nowhere in the instructions was this made clear and only after watching on line video reviews of the product did I realize why I could not make the solar panels generate input into the generator.
review58:,"I bought this to run lights for my booth at craft shows. After reading and watching hundreds of positive reviews, I thought I had found the perfect answer to my prayers! I did the math to be sure it would be able to supply the right amount of power that I needed, so I was super excited to give it a try. The first day I used it, it only lasted 5 hours and 50 minutes. Most of my shows are a minimum of 8 hours a day. When I found out that I wasn't allowed to return it, I was highly disappointed that I had wasted my money."
review59:,"Though it looks EXACTLY the same as other models, the input is very slightly different. My Jackery 300 takes a 7.9mm input, this takes an 8mm input. The 7.9 will fit but doesn't charge. Why not just make them all the same? You have to read VERY deep into the literature to find this info. Other than that, works great and has a built in solar charger so you can plug panels directly into it (not through their own controller if they have one)."
review60:,"I think Jackery makes a good product and that the design is well thought out. That being said, their product support desperately needs to be improved. I live in the Houston area and bought this product as part of my emergency preparedness setup. I tested it and was happy that it met my expectations. Then Hurricane Beryl hit, we were without power or cell phone service for nine days, and the AC outlets would not work. The display gave a fault code, but the instructions do not include a comprehensive list of fault codes. So I had no way to troubleshoot on my own. I had to drive out of the area to reach a place where I could get cell phone service, but their customer service does not have extended hours. When I finally did reach them, there was an astounding lack of urgency to resolve the problem. Each call was met with the reply that the appropriate team would get back to me within 48 hours. That was not acceptable! The item needed to be replaced, but they would not send the replacement until the defective item was received. Also not acceptable. There was way too much back and forth to resolve the issue, and their messages sometimes did not take into account information that was previously provided. It was a very frustrating experience, and I wound up converting my exchange into a return. It took a full 30 days of constant follow-up to receive my refund. Also not acceptable. The bottom line? Inadequate documentation and inept customer support."
review61:,"For the money you pay, it would be nice to get a cover over the Is cigarette lighter plug in. Also a bag n chargers with other ways of charging it. Like with the other brands n sizes."
review62:,"This is my 3rd Jackery unit I have purchased. I still have another older, 1000 W Jackery. Using the same amount of power, the old Jackery lasts nearly 3 times longer then this new one. While the new one charges way, way faster… it doesn’t last long."
review63:,Unfortunately these jackery 1000s don't work with diesel heaters which really bummed me out as I was in a 20 degree tent then found out.... as my 500 worked great but got stolen from my truck. Unfortunately a return for me now as thats one of my biggest reasons in wanting the Jackery. The heater gives a E02 error code which means its giving too much power to the heater. After going over all specs and everything that shouldnt of been an issue but sure is. Be careful getting this if using a diesel heater
review64:,"I really believed it would last at least for couple days, but it doesn't even last for a whole day, the only thing i connect is my laptop and it holds 6-8 hours max, what a waste..."
review65:,"BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS! I will say the battery came promptly and appears to do what it is supposed to do. Thankfully, haven't needed to use it, yet. The reason for warning is this DOES NOT come with solar panels. The description says ""solar powered"" and I even remember seeing a statement that the panels come separately. When I contacted Jackery, via Amazon, I was told the order I purchased didn't come bundled with the panels. There is NOTHING on the Amazon add that says the panels are not included. If you want to purchase the combination, you have to order directly from Jackery."
review66:,"Jackery charges a premium with their units than the competition. I bought their unit just because their perceived brand reputation thinking this may be safer and of better quality. I was completely wrong. The UPS function is not working properly likely due to a firmware bug. If the battery is charged 100% then it won't switch back to AC unless battery level is dropped to 99%. This can take very long if the battery is under light load and may be a hazard due to the voltage difference to the wall with other appliances. On inverter mode, the neutral also has voltage and the ground seems disconnected. This has caused my downstream appliances and surge protectors to report warning/faults. The Inverter has also damaged my computer PSU. I connected two computers, one turned on fine but the other started seriously vibrating. It was extremely loud and scary. The PSU seems to be permanently damaged. After this incident, every time on boot up it vibrates a bit. This is not acceptable and I had to return this item. The good part of the customer support experience are that seller provided shipment label. Also it accepted my price matching request within a week (before I found out all the problems and requested the return). But they never refunded me after receiving the return and has been falsely claiming that the refunding had been issued when questioned, though in reality even the Amazon customer service could not find the refund. I had to file a claim through Amazon to get my money back. To summarize, Jackery failed to perform proper QA to ensure proper functionality, used design/components that can cause damage, and their customer support, though prompt in response, gaslights and provides false information when issues occur."
review67:,"It used to be with a jackery product that you could simply plug whatever into it and it would just work. Outputs and inputs were all very flexible and they always worked. Now these next gen LifePO4 batteries are riddled with all kinds of glitches and temperamental behaviors. For example right now my battery shows 80% left and I want to top it off. I plug in the 12v cigarette adapter and it starts charging at 100 watts. Sounds good right? Nope, because after 5 seconds the battery reduced the charge input to 6 just watts which is terrible. Not a faulty plug or cord either. It’s jackery’s own cord. Ok, so I’ll use my inverter to charge it with 120v. Oh wait, can’t do that because my inverter is rated for 750 watts and the way this battery is designed it needs the full 1500 watt household rating just for it to recognize that input. Another terrible design. This thing can charge control to any wattage but it will only recognize one input wattage for 120v. So you basically can’t charge this from you RV’s inverter. Forcing someone to control certain features via the app is the final poor decision that lead me to return this. If they are going to force feed you to the app then make an app that actually works. The Bluetooth connection required drops or times out and it requires a complete new pairing to get connected again. Couldn’t return this fast enough. Last Chinese jackery product for me."
review68:,200w panel will give about 125W full sun. If you are lucky it will peak at 150W. The supplied cable likely reduces the power wattage. The 200w rating is likely theoretical direct at the combined cells without any external connectors or cables.
review69:,"Items come at different times, but you only get information on partial. Confusing as to whether everything will come together. Had to reach out to get additional information. It worked out, but confusing."
review70:,"***2 month update*** dependability ZERO, shuts off when it wants to, it has begun needing the reboot commands to get it operational again, absolute waste of money. ***original*** While it comes with a power cord for charging from a wall outlet, the seller separately only provides one DC connector for attaching a solar panel. However, there are two available input ports, and without this connector, the other port is essentially useless. The app that is supposed to pair with the unit rarely connects, and on my first trip, it completely stopped working. To make matters worse, the power button no longer turns off the unit, and every time it reaches a full 100% charge, it powers off once disconnected from the 120V power source which is annoying when you are not expecting the power to go out and reset your electronics (using it for video and satellite communications). Additionally, there's no straightforward way to charge the unit from a 12V DC source out of the box. This requires purchasing additional accessories, which is disappointing. Overall, I’ve encountered multiple frustrations with the unit, especially considering the cost."
review71:,"I recently bought a Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 solar generator that will charge just fine when plugged into 120 volts but will not charge from either of the two solar panels I have. I have a Dokio 200 watt solar panel that works perfectly and I use to charge my 12 Volt lead acid batteries using the charge controller. I plugged the Dokio and controller into my Jackery. It wouldn't charge. I plugged just the solar panel into my Jackery and even though the panels were putting out 14.9 volts the Jackery wouldn't charge. I called Jackery support and after a day or two got a call back and talked to a young lady with a thick accent who obviously knew nothing about electricity and simply told me to buy a jackery solar panel. I looked on Amazon for a Jackery solar panel but they were twice the price of everyone else's. I found a Grecell 200 watt solar panel that guaranteed compatibility with Jackery and ordered it. I plugged it into the jackery solar generator when it arrived but once again, the Jackery would not charge. I called jackery support again yesterday and I'm still waiting for a callback. I'm just about done with Jackery and my next call will either make or break whether I send the solar generator back for a refund. Stay tuned!"
review72:,"This is my sixth Jackery solar generator. Each iteration presents different standards for utilizing power and solar charging. This has always been disconcerting to me. When I set up this unit I plugged in a portable Jackery solar panel and could not make it work. I called Jackery—they explained that I needed an adapter, which they did not provide with the unit, furthermore they could not sell me an adapter because it was out of stock. Jackery is so greedy that they make their new products incompatible with their earlier products then leave the consumer solving a problem Jackery created and profits further from the solution. It feels like dealing with Apple. Note to Jackery, you are not Apple."
review73:,"Would not even power a light duty electric stapler on full charge. Good for lights and charging power tool batteries, and that's about it"
review74:,"Honestly, after having this item almost a month, I still don't know how well it works. It needs a proprietary connector to work with any solar panel but a Jackery brand. We ordered it (an additional $20) but we're not pleased, and may still return it."
review75:,"Unit was dead on arrival. Granted, Jackery offered to replace it, but I had already shipped it out of the US and could not ship it back. Thus, no replacement without sending the old unit back. Understandable, but be warned, these things have a reputation for being dead when they get to you (I am not the first to experience this problem)."
review76:,"Overpriced and unreliable. Multiple times throughout the night, it stays on but cuts power output. I would buy another brand. Very disappointed. Will be returning. review 77_ The item arrived today it was on sale for a package deal for the inverter and a solar panel photo includes my order receipt at a specially reduced price. The item arrived without the solar panel. The worst part is I had already ordered another unit that was refurbished back in June unfortunately it didn't work and I returned it I am still waiting for the refund from jackery I now have paid $900 for this combo and about another $500 for the other one I returned that I'm still waiting for the refund on and now I'm waiting for the other part and no word from jackery that it is on its way or acknowledging the problem at all"
review78:,This thing just almost caught my house on fire. The cord which was never used before today just caught on fire. I am livid! Decided to charge it in the house instead of with the solar panels and it caught fire. Bad cord! They sent my refund to he wrong place and did not credit my Amazon account as promised so I got nothing back. Do not buy from this company. I will not remove this unless they correct this issue.
review79:,This power station used battery power much more rapidly than it should and also was unable to run some items that were within the specs for wattage. Had to return it.
review80:,The Jackery Explorer appears to function OK. But the 200 W Solar panels are not putting out any wattage at all according to the Explorer. Nor are they charging the unit. Returning this.
review81:,Don't buy this. It's non-returnable. Absolutely not useable for tent camping. Stay with Coleman and ice. Turns out to be a very expensive mistake!
review82:,"Jackery Explorer 10000v2 did not work with my solar panels. After weeks of trying, they eventually took the unit back and refunded my money. To compensate for my hassles, they sent me a free Jackery 100."
review83:,"I ordered the 1000 v2 and solar panels. They shipped as two separate packages. The generator arrived on time. According to Amazon and the shipper the panels arrived today. But they didn't. We'll see what Jackery does to resolve this. This is generally a commentary on Jackery itself. For a quality company, they do seem to have issues with customer service, as in this case. As that is part of the whole experience, it seems like something they should pay better attention to. Once I get the panels I will review the package, but until they're here, that's a bit hard to do."
review84:,I got a 1500 watt generator. I use it to power a portable heater. I use it on low. And it periodically turns on and off on its own. The heater uses about 1300 watts. The battery only last 3 hours at most. If you are going to use this during long power outages think again. Please think of finding another generator.
review85:,"Battery drain quick, did not charge with solar panel."
review86,"Had issues with 2 items, both times customer service was either elusive/clueless or challenging to engage. I will no longer buy Jackery. Thanks and have a nice day."
review87:,"The title of the product suggests it comes with a solar generator, but it didn't. This makes the battery much less useful."
review88:,From this company at your own risk. Robert did not work and I had an almost impossible getting my money back. Avoid unless you just like headaches.
review89:,Item defective. Inverter portion wasn’t working. Asked to return. Given erroneous return instructions. Shipper would not accept due to the battery. Bad product and bad return instructions.
review90:,"Product seems to work okay but when I had a problem with the app that runs it, the company was not able to fix the problem. Undecided if I need to return it or not."
review91:,This unit wouldn't even run our space heater for 30min. Don't buy it. Get something else.
review92:,Two out of four batteries failed to charge.
review93:,We ONLY received the solar panel! We did NOT receive the generator! It shows that we got both but we did not!! We also have proof that the generator was NOT delivered!!
review94:,Got one that isn't working as advertised. Now I have to pay $50 in shipping to return it! Will update if shipping is paid for.
review95:,My order included solar panels but they weren’t shipped. I’ll change the rating when the issue is resolved.
review96:,"It came with wall cord,but does no chearge."
review97:,"Ordered mine directly from Jackery. Brand new out of the box had a 29% battery. I immediately plugged it in to get a full charge and it quoted me another 4.6 hours of charging. That’s funny, it specifically states a ‘full charge in 1.7 hours’ on all their literature….."
review98:,Love this jackery. It is extremely quiet. My only complaint is that the car charging cable from my previous jackerys does not work for this one. This is disappointing because this is why I’ve stayed with the same line.
review99:,Disappointed in power. I had purchased to have an electric backup for my koi pond pump. Lost power a couple of weeks ago and it was not able to provide enough power to run my pump.
review100:,"VERY UPSET that I received a USED generator. I paid the price for new and received something used. It works so far with the minimal testing I did, but I’m hoping it doesn’t show signs of whatever reason it whatever reason it was returned for."
